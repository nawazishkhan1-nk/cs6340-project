Celine Dion, Shania Twain, and Alanis Morissette picked up two grammys apiece. Among the awards, Ms. Dion won record of the year for \"My Heart Will Go On.\" But American hip-hop artist Lauryn Hill, beat them all. She took home five Grammys, including album of the year. Ms. Hill broke Carole King's 1971 record for most awards won by a female artist in a single night. \"This is crazy because this is hip-hop music,\" Ms. Hill said in accepting the first best-album Grammy for a hip-hop artist as the usually conservative awards show took its biggest step out of the mainstream. Rap has been eclipsing rock as the dominant musical form for young people, and routinely produces best sellers. Much of the credit goes to Ms. Hill, a 23-year-old mother of two whose music mixes rap and R and touches on family and political issues. She had won two earlier Grammys with the Fugees. Shania Twain, Stevie Wonder, the Dixie Chicks and the Brian Setzer Orchestra each were double winners Wednesday night. Sheryl Crow won for best rock album, and Madonna also picked up her first musical Grammy, including best pop album for her excursion into electronica, \"Ray of Light\". She also won best dance recording and best short form music video. \"I've been in the music business 16 years. It was worth the wait,\" Madonna said backstage. After 51 years of performing, Patti Page won her first Grammy, for traditional pop vocal performance for \"Live at Carnegie Hall -- The 50th Anniversary Concert\". She joked backstage that family members once asked what her grandchildren should call her. \"Grammy. Because I'll never get one,\" she recalled telling them. \"Now they can call me grandma.\" \"Titanic\" sailed on as the ballad \"My Heart Will Go On\" won four Grammys, including best female pop vocal for Celine Dion and best song written for a motion picture or television. James Horner and Will Jennings picked up the writing trophies. The movie's soundtrack was the top-selling album of 1998, with more than 9 million units sold. Mr. Horner told the Shrine Auditorium and national television audiences he initially considered the song just a movie theme. \"It spoke to a lot of people,\" Horner said backstage. \"It obviously was very romantic in a wistful, timeless way.\" He admitted he no longer listens to the song. Actor-rapper Will Smith won best rap song for his good-natured \"Gettin' Jiggy Wit It.\" He paid tribute to God, \"the jiggiest wife in the world\" (actress Jada Pinkett Smith) and his son, about whom he received bad news in his first parent-teacher conference Wednesday. \"His rhyming skills are down,\" Smith said. \"I swear -- that's what the teacher told me.\" Jay-Z's \"Vol. 2 ... Hard Knock Life\" won best rap album, though he skipped the show because he doesn't like the way the Grammys treat rap.

Last Thursday CBC4Kids explained why Saskatchewan Judge A. R. Rothery would not allow Tyrell to refuse cancer treatment. Justice Rothery said that it was in Tyrell's best interest to continue with chemotherapy even if he and his family were opposed. Tyrell was examined by doctors in Saskatoon on Friday. They were getting ready to follow the judge's orders and continue treating Tyrell. Instead the doctors discovered that cancer has spread from Tyrell's leg into his lungs. It has all but ended his chance of recovery. \"Tyrell's legal battles are over. The matter is most certainly in the hands of God, if it ever were in the hands of mortals,\" the Duecks' lawyer Owe Girths told a stunned crowd of supporters on Sunday. Doctors have told Tyrell they can do nothing more for him. He spent a quiet weekend at home as his family considered what to do now. \"He is suffering with some pain in his knee. The doctors have given him some pain control for that but he maintains the quiet confidence in his God that he has had since the beginning of this thing,\" Mr. Girths said. Tyrell first discovered a lump on his leg around his birthday, October 1, after he slipped in the shower. Bone cancer was diagnosed. He and his family fought to avoid standard cancer therapy, consisting of chemotherapy and at least the partial amputation of his leg. Chemotherapy consists of putting various chemicals into the body to destroy the cancer. The Dueck family are fundamentalist Christians and wanted to send the boy to Mexico for alternative treatment, which would include herbs and large doses of vitamins, and rely on the power of prayer. Saskatchewan's Social Services Department went to court twice to force the boy to submit to traditional treatment. Last week, a judge ordered Tyrell to resume treatment but the family planned to appeal. But none of that matters with the new diagnosis. Saskatchewan Social Services was to go to court this week to lift all the orders involving the boy's treatment. The boy's doctor has said only 10 per cent of patients survive with his form of cancer, a rare osteosarcoma, once it has moved into the lungs. Mr. Griffiths said Tyrell's parents Tim and Yvonne no longer harbour anger about being dragged through the courts while their son's illness worsened. \"There was perhaps momentary resentment but there is no longer any resentment on their part. They believe that this has all unfolded as God would have it unfold,\" says Mr. Griffiths. Other family members who heard yesterday's announcement weren't so sure. \"I think Tyrell would not be in the situation he is today if Social Services had not stepped in two months ago,\" said Kevin Hildebrandt, Tyrell's uncle.", "qas": [{"question": "Why did Judge A.

At least 46 people were killed and hundreds were left injured and homeless. A tornado is an extremely violent windstorm that is usually created within a thunderstorm or hurricane. The recognizable shape of the tornado is the swirling funnel cloud that extends from the base of a storm cloud to the ground. The Oklahoma state medical examiner said 40 people were killed in Oklahoma alone in Monday's storms, the largest of which formed about 110 kilometres southwest of Oklahoma City - cutting a path at least a kilometre wide as it moved north and east. About 400 kilometres miles north, a tornado spawned by the same storm system tossed mobile homes like tin cans, damaged houses and killed at least five people in Wichita, Kansas and its suburb of Haysville. Hospitals reported treating more than 80 people. Fred Irvin of the Sedgwick County Emergency Preparedness Office said today that the initial count of 10 deaths proved wrong when authorities realized victims had been counted twice. But authorities still fear more dead will be found. \"It is worse than what you can see,\" says Bob Thompson, a battalion chief for the Sedgwick County Fire Department. \"We'll probably find more deaths.\" The storm system began in southwest Oklahoma and moved into the neighboring state of Kansas. It included several tornadoes, one of which was nearly two kilometres wide at times. Witnesses say the twister was like a huge white train that came crashing through their homes. Chad Harris was with seven people inside his mobile home in Haysville when it was flipped over and demolished. Two of his companions were critically injured. \"I have no trailer,\" Harris said. \"We all rolled in it. It was the worst experience in my life.\" The Oklahoma City twister is ranked as an F-4 tornado, the second-strongest classification. An F-4 tornado has a wind speed of 333-419 kilometres per hour. It can level well-constructed houses, structures with weak foundations can be blown off some distance, cars are thrown and objects like trees can become airborne like missiles.

His parents feared that Geoffrey and his older sister would be killed in the Nazi bombing of England. But there was a way to keep the kids safe. They took advantage of the Commonwealth child evacuation program.  Over 2,600 British children were sent to live with families in other Commonwealth countries where the war was not raging. Over half of those children -- 1530 of them -- came to live in Canada as guests. Some, like Geoffrey Dewis, returned to Canada to spend the rest of their lives. During the war, the trip to Canada was not easy.  German submarines lurked in the North Atlantic sea where the boats traveled. They fired torpedoes at British and Allied ships. Geoffrey Dewis's ship was the last to arrive safely at its destination.  The next boatload of British kids, on a ship called The City of Benares, was torpedoed and sank. Seventy-seven children on board died. Tragically, that was the end of the \"guest child\" program.

The kids are named Clint, Arnold and Danny. This first Canadian cloning could lead to breakthroughs in the treatment of injuries like broken limbs and torn human tissues. The company used the same technology invented by Scottish scientists to clone Dolly the sheep in 1997. Cloning is the first step in a process that could ultimately lead to the mass production of a material known as BioSteel. Biosteel is an artificial spider silk developed by Nexia Biotechnologies. Company president Jeffrey Turner says the silk can be used in tissue repair, neurosurgery and sutures, and to create artificial tendons and ligaments, among other uses. Nexia aims to extract the spider silk from goat's milk. While nobody has yet made a fabric from biosteel, Mr. Turner is convinced the protein can be turned into a supermaterial because of its natural role in the silk of a spider's web. \"When you think of what a web has to do, its extreme strength makes perfect sense,\" he says. The silken threads of the web must be nearly invisible to prey and yet be able to bring a fly to a screeching halt. Clint, Arnold and Danny were born in March. To clone the triplet goats, a nucleus with a mass of cells from a source goat was placed in a petri dish and cultured. One of these cells was then implanted into a mature, unfertilized egg. This replaced the egg's original DNA, which had been removed. This process was done three times, each time using the same source cells. The eggs were then placed into two recipient mothers, with one female carrying two eggs, and the other the third. Because cells were taken from the same source, the three kids have exactly the same genetic makeup. The potential to mass-produce BioSteel is a main reason the animals were cloned in the first place. Mr. Turner says that BioSteel is the strongest substance known to man, with a tensile strength of 300,000 pounds per square inch. BioSteel is an artificial spider silk that is environmentally friendly, extremely strong and light, and compatible with the human body, says Mr. Turner. The company hopes eventually to extract this spider silk from goat's milk. Turner said the company will soon clone a sheep with the spider-silk gene in its genetic makeup. In the past year, the company tried injecting a spider-silk gene directly into the goat. But that system wasn't efficient enough. It worked on only four goats in a hundred. The new method could have close to a 100-per-cent success rate. Next year the company will clone another goat that will carry the spider-silk gene in its chromosomes. The silk protein can be extracted from the goat when it starts to produce milk. Turner said Nexia will clone only about three or four goats with the spider-silk protein. They can then reproduce with normal goats, and their offspring will still have the spider-silk gene in their bodies. But Clint, Arnold and Danny aren't making everyone happy. Some animal-rights activists and ethicists oppose the concept of cloning living beings. Professor Margaret Somerville says she does not agree with cloning for the purposes of creating a superior race of animals -- such as faster race horses or stronger elephants. However, she sees an argument in cloning animals \"for valid, justified purposes.\" The debate around cloning animals, food products and even human beings is growing all across the world.

Underwater footage shows \"tens of thousands of cod lying on the bottom, gutted. It looks pretty bad,\" says Mary MacNab, the government's seal industry promotions officer. \"From my own impression, it's the killing fields.\" The footage, filmed last week by fishermen using government supplied equipment, shows the ocean floor after a group of seals crowded cod into a bay and started feasting. Lloyd Oldford of Red Cliff, Bonavista Bay, a fisherman who first alerted Efford to the problem, said the video in no way shows the true extent of the destruction fishermen are seeing. \"I can show you 100 miles of it,\" said Oldford. \"There's nothing but dead fish in every crook and cranny. It's everywhere, massive destruction. It's taking away a great source of income from us. If we don't do something about this seal problem, more people are going to be leaving the province.\" John Efford, Newfoundland's fisheries minister, says the \"very disturbing\" images will wake up people to the toll seals are taking on northern cod stocks. There has been a moratorium - a temporary ban -  on fishing for cod since 1992 after fish stocks dropped to dangerous levels. \"We thought by bringing in the moratorium, that in a few years the cod stocks would start to return,\" he says. \"But seven years after the closure of the ground fish industry, stocks today are worse then they were previous to 1992. \"There's only one answer to that.... We've got an overpopulated seal herd.\" Mr. Efford says the seal herd, which is estimated at six million, needs to be cut in half. That would mean increasing the annual quota of 275,000 harp seals to between 475,000 and 575,000 animals. Jeff Hutchings, a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia says it is a stretch for Mr. Efford to use evidence of seals preying on cod in one location to argue for a massive cull (harvest) of the seal herd. \"The degree to which seals are retarding the recovery of cod stocks remains an open question. Maybe they are. Maybe they aren't.\" He adds that documentation of seals having eaten only the fish stomachs suggests scientists may have underestimated how many cod the seals kill. Researchers detect traces of fish in seal stomachs only if they eat the whole fish. Today, sealing comprises a vital part of Newfoundland's sluggish economy. In 1996 alone it was worth in excess of $11 million, with seal products being sold in Canada, Norway and Asia.", "qas": [{"question": "How does Newfoundland intend to use a film of seals feasting on cod?", "id": "1999-W11-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "to increase the seal hunt", "answer_start": 58}]}, {"question": "Why has there been a moratorium on cod fishing?", "id": "1999-W11-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "fish stocks dropped to dangerous levels", "answer_start": 1218}]}, {"question": "When was the moratorium instituted?", "id": "1999-W11-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1992", "answer_start": 1207}, {"text": "seven years ago", "answer_start": 1375}]}, {"question": "What is the estimated size of the seal herd?", "id": "1999-W11-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "six million", "answer_start": 1619}]}, {"question": "By how much does John Efford want to cut the seal herd?", "id": "1999-W11-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "in half", "answer_start": 1648}]}, {"question": "Where is Dalhousie University?", "id": "1999-W11-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Halifax, Nova Scotia", "answer_start": 1818}, {"text": "Nova Scotia", "answer_start": 1827}]}, {"question": "How much was sealing worth to the Newfoundland economy in 1996?", "id": "1999-W11-3-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "in excess of $11 million", "answer_start": 2447}]}]}]}, {"title": "Winnipeg Students form CNN Bureau", "paragraphs": [{"context": "The big cable news network CNN has opened up a new bureau.

He could face the death penalty. Ocalan's supporters have been protesting at Turkish, Greek and Israeli embassies in Europe and Canada. On Wednesday, after rumours that Israel helped Turkish securities forces capture Ocalan, angry Kurds tried to occupy the Israeli consulate in Berlin. Israeli guards opened fire on the protesters, killing three and injuring 16 others. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to calm Kurdish anger. But he defends the killings and says his nation had nothing to do with Ocalan's arrest. In Germany, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told the Kurds they must obey German laws and stop violent protests -- or they will be thrown out of the country. In Turkey, police have reportedly arrested hundreds of supporters of the main Kurdish party, while up to 4,000 soldiers have been sent into Northern Iraq to attack Kurdish rebel bases. Ocalan has lived outside Turkey since 1980. In recent months, Turkey has exerted diplomatic pressure on European countries to hand the rebel leader over for trial. Syria, Lebanon, Russia, the Netherlands and Italy, among others, had expelled him.", "qas": [{"question": "Who is Abdullah Ocalan?", "id": "1999-W08-4-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "rebel Kurdish leader", "answer_start": 100}]}, {"question": "What do the Kurdish separatists want?", "id": "1999-W08-4-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "an independent Kurdistan", "answer_start": 206}, {"text": "a separate Kurdish homeland", "answer_start": 1100}]}, {"question": "Why did Kurds all over the world hold violent demonstrations?", "id": "1999-W08-4-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Abdullah Ocalan was arrested", "answer_start": 121}, {"text": "the arrest of rebel Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan", "answer_start": 86}, {"text": "Abdullah Ocalan was captured", "answer_start": 121}]}, {"question": "How did an Ottawa police officer get burned?", "id": "1999-W08-4-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "demonstrators hurled a gasoline bomb", "answer_start": 536}]}, {"question": "What triggered some Kurds to try to occupy the Israeli consulate in Berlin?", "id": "1999-W08-4-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "rumours that Israel helped Turkish securities forces capture Ocalan", "answer_start": 1285}]}, {"question": "How many protesters were injured at the Israeli consulate in Berlin?", "id": "1999-W08-4-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "16", "answer_start": 1488}]}, {"question": "What did Chancellor Schroeder tell the Kurds in Germany?", "id": "1999-W08-4-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "they must obey German laws and stop violent protests -- or they will be thrown out of the country", "answer_start": 1718}]}, {"question": "When did Ocalan start living outside of Turkey?", "id": "1999-W08-4-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1980", "answer_start": 2040}]}, {"question": "Why has Turkey sent soldiers into Northern Iraq?", "id": "1999-W08-4-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "to attack Kurdish rebel bases", "answer_start": 1971}]}]}]}, {"title": "Julie Blasts Off Safely", "paragraphs": [{"context": "This morning at 6:48 Eastern Daylight Time, Julie Payette's 25-year-old dream came true. She blasted off into space aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery. The 35-year-old Quebecer has wanted to go to space since she was 10. She had a poster of Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, on her bedroom wall. \"I was fascinated by those trips the astronauts made to the moon, by their space suits, by their experiences, the equipment they used -- especially the lunar module and the lunar vehicle,\" she says. \"I wanted to be like them. I wanted to be an astronaut.\" Believe it or not, at school Julie used to skip recess so she could do her homework. And she used to exercise so much she would make herself sick. \"I had trouble getting her to stop working,\" says Sister Yolande Perrault, who was her French teacher. \"I would tell her, 'Julie, take a break.'\" Now all that work has paid off. Along with being an astronaut, Julie is a computer engineer, can speak 5 languages (French, English, German, Spanish and Russian), has competed in triathalon races (swimming, running, and biking), is a deep-sea diver, and has a jet pilot's licence. Julie is also interested in the arts - she plays the piano and is a soprano singer. Julie's space dream finally began to come true last year when she was selected for mission STS-96, which was supposed to launch on May 20th, 1999. But fulfilment of her dream had to wait until today, after a hail storm damaged the insulation on the Discovery's fuel tanks a few days before the scheduled launch. Although she will not be the first Canadian woman in space, she will be the first Canadian astronaut to enter and work on the International Space Station platform, launched last year by the United States and Russia. Her tasks will include unloading and arranging the 2,200 kilograms of equipment being carried to the station for future astronauts; working the remote-control Canadarm while supervising crew members constructing parts of the station, and documenting the mission's progress with video cameras. Julie will also have to help change the 18 solar batteries on the station module Zarya. Each battery is roughly the size of a cellular phone. That task will be undertaken with Russian astronaut Valery Tokarev. To make sure the job is done correctly, Payette learned Russian so she could communicate with Tokarev. She has been training for the mission since 1992, when she was first selected to be an astronaut by the Canadian Space Agency. Prime Minister Jean Chretien paid tribute to the Montrealer as a credit to the space program and the country. \"I'm telling you she's creating a great impression in the land. She's very young, very articulate and perfectly bilingual and she's showing the Canadian colours with pride and dignity and we should pray for her that everything will be all right, and it will be,\" said Mr. Chretien Aline Chretien, the Prime Minister's wife, was invited by Julie Payette to watch the launch in Florida. Yesterday evening Aline Chretien told her husband that her friend was \"starting to have butterflies.\" \"I guess I would have a few, too, sitting on that much power,\" said the Prime Minister.", "qas": [{"question": "How long has Julie Payette wanted to be an astronaut?", "id": "1999-W22-4-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "25 years", "answer_start": 60}]}, {"question": "When she was in school, what would Julie do instead of going to recess?", "id": "1999-W22-4-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "homework", "answer_start": 644}]}, {"question": "How many languages does Julie speak?", "id": "1999-W22-4-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "5", "answer_start": 61}]}, {"question": "When was Julie selected to be an astronaut by the Canadian Space Agency?", "id": "1999-W22-4-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1992", "answer_start": 2405}]}, {"question": "Where will the space shuttle Discovery be taking Julie?", "id": "1999-W22-4-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the International Space Station platform", "answer_start": 1661}]}, {"question": "What will Julie use to document the mission progress?", "id": "1999-W22-4-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "video cameras", "answer_start": 2033}]}, {"question": "Who will be Julie work with to change solar batteries?", "id": "1999-W22-4-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Russian astronaut Valery Tokarev", "answer_start": 2224}, {"text": "Valery Tokarev", "answer_start": 2242}]}, {"question": "Who is Aline Chretien married to?", "id": "1999-W22-4-11", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Prime Minister Jean Chretien", "answer_start": 2488}, {"text": "Jean Chretien", "answer_start": 2503}, {"text": "the Prime Minister", "answer_start": 2895}]}, {"question": "When was the International Space Station launched?", "id": "1999-W22-4-12", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "last year", "answer_start": 1274}]}]}]}, {"title": "Canadian's Nightmare in Mexico Nearly Over", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Pascal Hudon's nightmarish trip to Mexico is almost over. Today he is in a Mexican hotel, waiting to find out when he will finally be allowed to fly back to Montreal. Pascal, who is 20, was released yesterday from the Chiapas state penitentiary of Cerro Hueco -- where he had staged a hunger strike to protest his arrest last September 28th. He was set free after relatives paid a $1,200 fine. Last fall Mexican prosecutors charged Pascal with stealing small clay figurines from the Palenque ruins. He was put in jail in January. A local judge found Hudon guilty of the theft charges. Under Mexican law, all pre-Hispanic artifacts are considered national treasures. \"He's very happy because he's returning to his country,\" his lawyer, Alphonso Herrera Gonzalez, said. \"He called me from a pay phone to say he was finally free,\" his mother, Jocelyne Dion, told the french language newspaper Le Journal de Montreal. \"He was shouting with joy.\" For the Mexican authorities, their fight to prevent the looting of Mexico's vast stash of historical treasures is far from resolved. \"Looting and the illegal export of archeological goods is fairly prevalent,\" says Joaquin Garcia, chairman of Mexico's archeology council. Mexico has about 200,000 archeological sites, and only about 150 are monitored constantly and open to the public, he said. \"It's quite difficult to take care of them. We depend much on the people who live near the sites.\" Although Mexico has had laws to prevent looting since the middle of the 19th century, Mexicans have become increasingly alarmed lately about losing their national heritage to looters, and have started to apply their laws with greater vigilance. Mr. Hudon was a prime example of the new get-tough attitude. The former college student was found carrying eight pieces of ceramics, which he said he found on a path in the bush near the Palenque historical site in southern Mexico. Mr. Hudon has said he had intended to hand over the pottery to authorities, but before he had a chance to do so, he was stopped by police. They searched him and charged him with illegally possessing artifacts. He was put in a federal prison in Tuxtla Gutierrez in Chiapas state in the south of Mexico at the beginning of January. At a trial in February, he was sentenced to a year in jail plus one month of labour, and told to pay $72,000 to the National Institute of History and Anthropology. His family and friends in Montreal protested, and Mr. Hudon went on a hunger strike. The Canadian embassy intervened, and Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy spoke publicly about the need to get the young man out of prison in Chiapas. Last month, Mr. Hudon appealed the case. He was allowed to give a new statement through a translator. The judge ruled that he was not legally obliged to pay $72,000 to the institute, and lowered the fine to $2,500. Artifacts, some dating back tens of thousands of years, are frequently stolen when sites are discovered by excavators or through small-scale looting, he said. There has been looting at only three major projects in the past 15 years -- projects run by foreign experts. All three were halted and many artifacts recovered. Small-scale looting, however, has landed between 40 and 50 people in jail every year. And Mr. Garcia is sure much theft goes undetected. Despite his serious troubles, Pascal has not lost the urge to travel. He told his mom that after he visits with his family back in Montreal, he wants to head out to British Columbia to work as a tree-planter.

The NATO troops are there to make sure that Yugoslavian soldiers leave the area. At least 10,000 Serbian soldiers and police have already left, along with all Serb military aircraft. But as NATO troops pour into the province, many of its residents feel they must leave. Clutching teddy bears, pet dogs and rifles, citizens of Serbian heritage streamed out of Prizren, Kosovo's second-largest city today. Many of them are afraid of the anger of their neighbours of Albanian heritage. They fear that when the ethnic Albanians return to the area now that the war is over, they may try to take revenge on the ethnic Serbs. With belongings lashed to the top of their cars, the new refugees said they were heading northwards to the Kosovo capital of Pristina or all the way to Serbia itself. Many were lifelong residents of Prizren. \"We don't know where we are going. NATO can't guarantee our safety,\" said one man, his family gathered around a packed car as it prepared to join waves of people that began leaving today. \"War is terrible,\" said a mother, her daughter preparing to put the family dog Licky into one of a line of cars jamming a cobblestone hillside street. On a nearby square, passengers climbed aboard a bus bound for Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital. There was no harassment from ethnic Albanian residents of Prizren, who like others across Kosovo, say they suffered looting, humiliation and expulsion at the hands of the Serb military and police. \"This is not a fight between Albanians and Serbs. We have long lived together. Many of us wept when they were forced to leave,\" said the theology professor. \"This is the politics of communism, of President Slobodan Milosevic.\" Thirteen hundred Canadian soldiers will participate in the occupation of Kosovo. Five hundred of them come from the Princess Patricia Canadian Light Infantry in Edmonton. They will serve with a British armoured brigade. Canadian troops are as well serving on a ship, the HMCS Athabascan, which is sailing in the Adriatic Sea, just off the coast of Yugoslavia. NATO spokesman Jamie Shea says troop deployment is going \"very smoothly\" and is slightly ahead of schedule.

Amen.\" -from a Doukhobor Prayer. British Columbia's ombudsman says the provincial government should apologize to and compensate the children of a controversial religious group who were locked up in an internment camp during the 1950s. An ombudsman is a person who is appointed by a government to investigate individuals' complaints against public authorities. Ombudsman Dulcie McCallum said an investigation found the 170 Doukhobor children were subjected to abuse and suffered \"loss of love, nurturing guidance and childhood\" while they were detained from 1953 to 1959. Children and their parents were members of the Sons of Freedom sect (group) of the Doukhobor faith. The sect strongly condemned private property and government control. They refused to send children to public schools. Provincial officials and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police held the truant children, many of whom spoke only Russian, at a former sanatorium - a hospital for people with tuberculosis - in New Denver, British Columbia, and forced them to attend local public schools. \"The children were caught in a situation not of their own making, nor within their control. They were caught in a web of conflicting values and political turmoil, involving their parents, religious leaders, police and the government,\" Ms. McCallum says in her report. The report said one example of the mistreatment was that children could only visit with their parents through a chain-link fence that the children themselves had been forced to construct. Here what some of the Doukhobors remember about the fence: And for some reason they put up this fence and once in two weeks you get to see your parents through a fence. I mean it was kind of degrading and, the thing is they even had us build the fence, you know. We were digging the holes for the fence. As a child you don't register the impact of it. Like, so they're doing something, they're building a fence. Didn't really question why, and then after, you know, slowly realized that well, wait a minute, we're imprisoning ourselves here. \"As a result of the maltreatment, those who were institutionalized in New Denver suffered harm and continue to suffer from the long-term ill-effects of this trauma,\" wrote Ms. McCallum. She says British Columbia should apologize to the religious sect and compensate the children. Provincial officials are studying the report and preparing a response. \"I want to acknowledge the feelings of the children who were separated from their families.

It's part of the Ontario government's plan to introduce a common code of conduct by next September for the province's 2.1 million students from kindergarten to Grade 12. Ontario's Education Minister Dave Johnson said students, parents and teachers will all be asked to discuss their opinions about uniforms before any final decisions are made. \"Short of a common uniform, there may be a style of dress that may be appropriate within a school,\" Johnson said on Tuesday. \"There are many people in the province who feel that uniforms add a tone of authority and discipline to a school and make for a better learning environment.\" The common code of conduct has started with a new safety policy that requires schools to phone parents to find out why absent students are missing. The code would also deal with acceptable language and set out the punishment for students who smoke, destroy property, steal, distribute hate material or carry a weapon. These are still up for debate. Johnson believes stricter discipline at schools will produce students with better grades and young adults with responsible attitudes. \"If students are dressed in a sloppy manner, that kind of habit and dress may flow over into their learning habits and make it difficult to conduct proper teaching,\" he said. Ontario Premier Mike Harris, 54, believes the province's kids are not what they used to be. He said he remembers the times depicted in the 1950s TV sitcom, Leave it to Beaver. Harris, a former teacher and parent to two young boys, said students need to learn some respect. \"They need to know what the line is,\" he said Tuesday. \"What's acceptable and what isn't and that there are consequences for going over that line.\" Swearing at a teacher, for example, might mean suspension, Harris said. For violence, the punishment could be expulsion.

The United States placed itself above international law, says a friend of the late man's family. \"The United States is one of our world leaders and world powers, and yet they allow the basic human rights of people to be violated in their own country,\" said Charlene Gingera, about an hour after Faulder was killed by an injection of deadly chemicals. Ms. Gingera spoke on behalf of family members who wanted to grieve Faulder's death privately. She was referring to the fact that both Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy and his U.S. counterpart, Madeleine Albright, agreed Faulder was denied his international rights because Texas officials failed to tell Canadian diplomats that he was in jail. Most countries in the world have agreed that this must be done when they arrest a citizen of another country. Texas Governor and presidential candidate George W. Bush refused to grant a stay of the execution, saying there was no new evidence that questioned the jury's verdict in the death of Inez Phillips, who Faulder was convicted of killing in 1977. \"Had Stan Faulder been a Texan in Iran or Serbia and he was not notified of his right to seek help from the U.S. consulate had he been detained, would the U.S.A. tolerate it? I don't think so,\" Ms. Gingera says. \"They are undermining international law by saying that Texas has to go ahead with what they believe to be right.\" Ms. Gingera has been working with the Faulder family since 1997 to try to get human rights groups interested in the case. She acknowledges that Americans fighting the death penalty are just a few small voices. But she adds: \"I think Stan's death will certainly be a loud voice. There are many people from around the world who responded to his case and that will not go unheard.\" Ms. Gingera says she was alarmed by comments from Alberta Reform Member of Parliament Cliff Breitkreuz, who wanted Texas officials to ignore the argument that Mr. Faulder's rights were violated when he wasn't told he could contact Canadian consular officials when he was charged with murder. \"It's frightening to see people like... Cliff Breitkreuz and various people in the province of Alberta or Canada who say it's OK to ignore a violation of international law, it's OK to ignore a violation of human rights....\" She says while Faulder's supporters struggled with their anger Thursday, the inmate himself was peaceful. \"Stan's peace had really spread to many people and his peace truly helped his friends and family around him to be filled with a sense of peace.\" In the last few days, Mr. Faulder's relatives had hoped for a stay of execution but they weren't overly optimistic, she says. \"They did know that this was something that could really happen.\" Canada does not execute prisoners.", "qas": [{"question": "When was the last time a Canadian was executed in the United States?", "id": "1999-W25-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1952", "answer_start": 177}]}, {"question": "Of which province in Canada was Stanley Faulder a native?", "id": "1999-W25-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Alberta", "answer_start": 103}]}, {"question": "What would a stay of execution have allowed?", "id": "1999-W25-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Faulder's lawyer to continue her quest to allow him to live", "answer_start": 475}]}, {"question": "How was Faulder killed?", "id": "1999-W25-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "by an injection of deadly chemicals", "answer_start": 850}]}, {"question": "What has Charlene Gingera been working with the Faulder family to do since 1997", "id": "1999-W25-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "to try to get human rights groups interested in his case", "answer_start": 1990}]}, {"question": "Why did Texas Governor George W.

They believe the Canadian wrestler's costume had something to do with the tragedy. The accident happened Sunday at a World Wrestling Federation event. Owen Hart was being lowered into the ring from the rafters of the arena. Police say Mr. Hart's cape may have been tangled with the release cord on his harness, causing it to release too early. Mr. Hart fell 18 metres into the ring. Mr. Hart's brother Ron blames the accident on the Wrestling Federation's constant search for more spectacular stunts and the desire to attract more television viewers. The WWF says the stunt will never be performed again. It seems it takes more than a full nelson or a vicious body slam to impress the rabid pro wrestling fans of the '90s. \"Frankly, wrestling was getting so far out and my poor brother Owen was a sacrifice for the television ratings,\" says Owen's sister Ellie Hart. Yesterday brother Bret \"Hitman\" Hart, also a wrestler, told an American televison network that Owen was uneasy about the stunt, \"but somehow over the weekend he got talked into doing it again.\" \"We're professional wrestlers,\" Bret Hart said. \"We take our falls on the mat, inside the ring. \"I was never a stuntman, and my brother Owen was never a stuntman.\" Keith Pelley, who is vice-president of programming for the Canadian television network TSN (which carries wrestling), says the WWF's ratings are among his network's highest. TSN carries the WWF's Raw is War show every week. \"The WWF and curling are probably our two highest-rated shows. You would be surprised by how many closet wrestling fans there are. The average viewer is 18 to 49, with the 34 to 49 age group being very dominant.\" Wrestling is now so mainstream that a former star Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura was elected governor of the American state of Minnesota, and Hulk Hogan is considering running for president of the United States. But that has not stopped many people from questioning the violent nature of the sport and wondering if more restrictions should not be put on when it is aired. Wrestling is one of the world's oldest sports. There are dozens of varieties practiced all over the world, from Sumo wrestling in Japan to Greco-Roman wrestling practiced in Europe.

But many of the young smokers he's targeting aren't so sure. The warnings cover half of each side of a cigarette package. There are 16 messages and images, including pictures of diseased lungs. Teenage smokers at a high school in Ottawa say some of the warnings are funny, but others, like an image showing a mouth full of rotting teeth, are disturbing and may make them think twice. \"I have to say this one with the teeth is quite disgusting. And I'm sure it will discourage a few smokers from starting up anyway,\" said one of the teens. But a 17-year-old smoker said he knows all about the dangers of his habit and new warnings won't make him quit. \"If you smoke, you know what's going to happen to you. Just seeing it a warning label is going to gross you out every time you take a cigarette. It's not really going to stop you.\" But Rock believes the warnings will make a difference. He says his department has done extensive surveys and he thinks the labels will be effective. \"Our testing, our focus groups and our surveys demonstrated that the old style warnings are losing their force. It's important for us now to take fresh steps and that's what we're doing today.\" Anti-smoking organizations have applauded the strategy. The Non-Smokers Rights Association says the labels will give people a graphic reminder of the harmful effects of smoking a cigarette. But the plan has a very powerful enemy. The tobacco industry is considering whether it should take the government to court. The Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Association, which represents tobacco companies, says it would take two years and cost millions of dollars to change the packaging on Canadian cigarettes. Spokesman Rob Parker is convinced the warnings won't work. \"They're still doing the same old thing, yelling even louder at smokers to quit or non-smokers not to start. It hasn't worked,\" says Mr. Parker. The minister says he hopes to have the new cigarette packages on store shelves by the end of the year.

Later today Wayne Gretzky will be competing again. At four o'clock this afternoon, the player hockey fans say is probably the best the game has ever known, and that some people say is the greatest professional athlete ever will be... bowling. The revelation came late in yesterday's news conference. In front of hundreds of reporters from all over North America and Europe Wayne Gretzky announced that he was going to hit the 10-pin bowling lanes in New York City. \"I'm going to spend the afternoon with my teammates - a bowling party and I'm looking forward to it, I'm going to enjoy. I've only bowled in Canada and it's five pin, they tell me here its 10 pin. I don't know if I can lift the ball. \" Yesterday was an emotional day for Gretzky fans. With tears and typical grace, Wayne Gretzky skated away from professional hockey. It's the second time in three months that one of the world's premier athletes has chosen to retire. \"It was a tough game for me today,\" Mr. Gretzky said of his farewell from the sport he dominated for two decades. \"I wanted it to be a celebration. \"You know, this is not a passing on,\" he added, his eyes watery. \"This is a moving on.\" It was a moving scene as the sport's greatest player said goodbye. The National Hockey League also retired No. 99, which commissioner Gary Bettman announced would never be worn in the league again. Gretzky has been the National Hockey League's Michael Jordan -- an almost mythical figure that fans of all teams admired and packed arenas to see. Perhaps fittingly, Jordan himself appeared in a second-period video, telling Gretzky, \"Your golf game is not going to get better, so don't think that will help. Relax and enjoy being a dad.\" \"It's always too soon when you see a great player retire,\" said Mario Lemieux, the retired Pittsburgh Penguins centre. \"It's going to be very difficult for the National Hockey League to lose the best hockey player that ever played, and he's been such a great ambassador for the game for 20 years.\" In front of Lemieux sat Mark Messier - who played with Mr. Gretzky for the Edmonton Oilers - and many other former teammates and opponents who admired \"The Great One\". When the game was over (the Penguins won 2-1) Gretzky smiled through tears during four final laps of Madison Square Garden. He skated slowly enough for plenty of souvenir photos to be taken of the player who holds or shares 61 NHL records. Whenever he noticed a youngster's extended hand from the crowd, he touched it. He even played to the fans, donning a blue Yankees hat, then a red Rangers beret. Then, almost as suddenly as word had come last week that he was retiring, Number 99 was gone. \"I'm devastated I will no longer be a hockey player,\" said Wayne Gretzky, 38, his eyes still red, said more than an hour after his final skate. \"I will miss every part of the game, because I loved every part of the game. \"But I've made the right decision.\" As he left the arena, Wayne's father and mother told him they were proud of him.", "qas": [{"question": "How long did Gretzky dominate the sport of hockey?", "id": "1999-W17-1-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "two decades", "answer_start": 1169}, {"text": "20 years", "answer_start": 2127}]}, {"question": "Who won the last game Gretzky played?", "id": "1999-W17-1-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the Penguins", "answer_start": 2330}, {"text": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "answer_start": 1931}]}, {"question": "Where did Gretzky play his last hockey game?", "id": "1999-W17-1-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Madison Square Garden", "answer_start": 2407}]}, {"question": "Why will the number 99 never be worn again by a professional hockey player?", "id": "1999-W17-1-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "it has been retired", "answer_start": 1510}, {"text": "it has been retired by the National Hockey League", "answer_start": 1371}]}, {"question": "When did Gretzky's parents tell him they were proud of him?", "id": "1999-W17-1-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "as he left the arena", "answer_start": 3058}]}, {"question": "Why did Gretzky say he was \"devastated\"??", "id": "1999-W17-1-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "because he will no longer be a hockey player", "answer_start": 2819}]}, {"question": "How will Wayne Gretzky be competing again?", "id": "1999-W17-1-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "bowling", "answer_start": 370}, {"text": "bowling at a party with teammates", "answer_start": 2096}]}, {"question": "What did Gretzky do when he saw a youngster's hand extended from the crowd?", "id": "1999-W17-1-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "he touched it", "answer_start": 2610}]}, {"question": "Who played with Gretzky on the Edmonton Oilers?", "id": "1999-W17-1-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Mark Messier", "answer_start": 2162}]}]}]}, {"title": "Labrador Inuit close to land deal", "paragraphs": [{"context": "The Labrador Inuit have voted yes on a deal that would allow them to create their own Inuit homeland called Nunasiavut.

There is only one unionized McDonald's restaurant in North America. It is in Squamish, British Columbia. About 90 per cent of the outlet's 55 workers voted against unionizing. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters had been trying to organize the workers for 16 months. Rejean Lavigne, head of the Teamsters local behind the campaign, said almost all of the original employees who signed union cards in 1997 had quit and the new ones, some as young as 16, didn't want a union. \"If we lose, well, we can't do anything more,\" Lavigne said before the vote was tallied. \"If the employees don't want us there, what are you going to do?\" A statement from McDonald's Quebec regional office welcomed the vote. \"We believe that giving all the employees in the outlet the opportunity to determine the outcome of this matter was the fairest and most responsible way to resolve the question of union representation,\" the statement said. The McDonald's in Squamish became the first unionized outlet among the chain's more than 15,000 outlets in North America when the Canadian Auto Workers made a breakthrough last August. Rejection of the union in Montreal was the second failure for the Teamsters against the chain. Last year, a franchise in suburban St-Hubert, Quebec shut down just as the union was about to be certified. The latest loss means an end to a campaign begun last year to unionize at least one McDonald's in every major city across Canada, which has so far cost the Teamsters about $100,000.

The Alberta Teachers Association says it's frustrating to see the provincial government more preoccupied with tax cuts than education. Local union president Kurt Moench says funding needs to be provided for teacher salaries and student growth. Class size is the biggest stumbling block in the dispute between the board and the teachers' union. The teachers say that there are too many students in each class and that means students are not getting all of the help they need. The 6,600 teachers want the return of a ratio of one teacher for every 18.4 students. Alberta Premier Ralph Klein said even he expects teachers to walk off the job. \"I think there's going to be a strike -- I hope that there won't be,\" said Klein in Edmonton, the province's capitol city. The province's education minister has urged both sides to keep talking. While a strike will leave more than 95,000 students in academic limbo and parents scrambling to make alternate arrangements, Grade 12 diploma exams will go on.

Students at W.R. Myers high school had just settled down after lunch when a 14-year-old boy walked in and shot two students, killing one. The shooting comes a week after the shooting tragedy at Columbine high school in Littleton, Colorado. \"We have a son and daughter-in-law in Denver,\" says Pastor Gartly after an evening service at Taber Evangelical Free Church where worshipers discussed the day's tragic events. The dead teenager has been identified as Jason Lang, 17. The other victim, Shane Christmas, also 17, had emergency surgery yesterday at Lethbridge Regional Hospital. This morning his condition was reported as fair to serious. The two grade 11 students were said to be best friends. Eight thousand people live in Taber, which is 300 kilometres southeast of Calgary. Many members of the community are members of the Mormon Church or are evangelical Christians. Taber was founded at the beginning of the century. It is mainly made up of decendents of the area's early homestead pioneers, of Central European, Polish, Japanese, Dutch and various other racial backgrounds. Many Japanese came in 1943, Polish war veterans in 1947, and many Dutch immigrants came after about 1950. Many native Canadians also live in the region. \"You feel pain for the families, the young fellow who was shot and killed is a son of people we've gotten to know, his father is a pastoral colleague,\" said Mr. Gartly. \"Our youth pastor spent 45 minutes with the youth group tonight. But we believe it's important to pray and we're certainly praying for those involved. \"We prayed for the family that lost a son, we prayed for a family that has a son in critical condition, we prayed for the fellow responsible and we prayed for ourselves that we can relate to people in a way that can comfort, encourage and help them.\" The evening event at the church was a scheduled visit of a choir from Providence College and Seminary in Otterburn, Manitoba. The group is on a tour of Alberta and British Columbia and were unaware of the day's events when they arrived in Taber. Gartly said he and the group sat down and modified the original program to make it relevant to the shootings at the high school. \"People asked for guidance in what to say to the kids, and one high school girl asked for people to reach out to God.\" Police confirmed the gunman was taken into custody by the school resource officer, who is also a member of the Taber Police Service.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the population of Taber?", "id": "1999-W18-4-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "eight thousand", "answer_start": 838}]}, {"question": "Who shot two students at a high school in Taber?", "id": "1999-W18-4-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a 14 year-old boy", "answer_start": 214}]}, {"question": "Where is the Taber gunman now?", "id": "1999-W18-4-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the gunman was taken into custody by the school resource officer", "answer_start": 2459}, {"text": "the police have him", "answer_start": 116}]}, {"question": "Who died in the Taber shooting?", "id": "1999-W18-4-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Jason Lang", "answer_start": 597}, {"text": "a grade 11 student", "answer_start": 790}]}, {"question": "Why were yesterday evening's activities at Taber Evangelical Free Church modified?", "id": "1999-W18-4-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "to make it relevant to the shootings at the high school", "answer_start": 2266}, {"text": "People asked for guidance in what to say to the kids", "answer_start": 2324}]}, {"question": "When was there a school shooting in Colorado?", "id": "1999-W18-4-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a week before the Taber shooting", "answer_start": 297}, {"text": "a week ago", "answer_start": 297}]}]}]}, {"title": "Maple Leaf Gardens Closes its Doors", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Maple Leaf Gardens. More than a hockey rink, it's a cultural institution. It may well be the strongest link between Toronto and the rest of Canada. And this weekend, the Gardens are losing the Maple Leafs. For thousands of people from coast to coast to coast, this Saturday is a special hockey night in Canada. It will be the last time the Leafs take to the ice at Maple Leaf Gardens. With the end in sight, the hype -- and mourning -- is beginning in earnest. More than one building in one city, the Gardens has long been a focal point for Canadian culture -- at least for anyone who has ever strapped on the blades. For decades, NHL games were broadcast into living rooms From Plum Coulee, Manitoba to Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia, and beyond from one of two places -- the Gardens or the Montreal Forum. With the end in sight, fond memories are starting to flow. In recent weeks, for example, hockey fans from Western Canada have been making the trek to Toronto to see one last game at the Gardens. Two weeks ago Brent Shuya and his son made the 3-and-a-half hour drive from their home in Russell, Manitoba to Winnipeg. There they hopped on an airplane for another two hour ride to Toronto.  The reason: to see their one and only hockey game at Maple Leaf Gardens. Brent says, \"it was pretty important to me, I wanted my son to go and visit the Gardens, seeing how they are not going to be playing there anymore. I've always been a Leaf fan probably since I was five or six years old and I guess I always will be whether they win or lose, and it was just nice to see them play in their old home.\" But Brent Shuya is by no means the only western hockey fan who has made one final pilgrimage to Maple Leaf Gardens. On his trip he met other fans from the Prairies doing the same thing. There is no one explanation as to why some fans outside Toronto feel such a strong attachment to the Leafs and the building in which they play, although radio and television have had much to do with it. Fans like Winnipeg businessman Jeff Thompson will be at the final game on Saturday. \"The Gardens and the Montreal Forum were both places that although we were never there, as kids growing up we were there,\" he says. \"They came into our house every weekend. It became larger than life because we had grown up watching it\". Winnipeger Bill Juzda was known as one of the toughest players in the NHL when he played for the Leafs in the 1950s. Mr. Juzda expects many of those at the final game Saturday will feel pretty much the way he did when he first walked into Maple Leaf Gardens nearly 50 years ago. He says, \"you walked in and you seen all those pictures in the lobby and everything else. And you stood outside and said, hey, I used to listen to Foster Hewitt on the radio and boy am I lucky to be here.\" Foster Hewitt was the Maple Leafs' radio broadcaster for decades. His voice was known by Canadians from coast to coast. He first broadcast a hockey game on the radio in March, 1923. Decades later he became the Leafs' first television announcer. In Toronto, many residents are sad to see the Leafs abandon the Gardens for the new Air Canada Centre. One fan is Tommy Gaston. For almost 60 years, the 82-year-old and his wife Ruth were in their seats for Leafs home games -- Grey Section West, Seats 13 and 14. After Saturday, the Gastons will have just their fond memories of the Gardens, built in 1931. But Gaston won't have trouble preserving his memories. A self-described pat rack, he has collected enough memorabilia to stock his basement -- and donate the overflow to the Hockey Hall of Fame.", "qas": [{"question": "What type of sports facility does Maple Leaf Gardens function as?", "id": "1999-W07-4-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a hockey rink", "answer_start": 30}]}, {"question": "When was the Maple Leaf Gardens built?", "id": "1999-W07-4-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1931", "answer_start": 3388}]}, {"question": "Where is the Maple Leaf Gardens?", "id": "1999-W07-4-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Toronto", "answer_start": 116}]}, {"question": "How far did Brent Shuya and his son have to drive just to reach Winnipeg?", "id": "1999-W07-4-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "3 and a half hours", "answer_start": 3290}, {"text": "3 1/2 hours", "answer_start": 1045}]}, {"question": "When did Foster Hewitt start broadcasting Maple Leaf games on the radio?", "id": "1999-W07-4-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "March, 1923", "answer_start": 2961}]}, {"question": "Where did Tommy and Ruth sit for the Leaf's games at the Gardens?", "id": "1999-W07-4-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Grey Section West, Seats 13 and 14", "answer_start": 3264}]}, {"question": "Who was known as one of the toughest players in the NHL in the 1950s?", "id": "1999-W07-4-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Bill Juzda", "answer_start": 2318}]}]}]}, {"title": "Canadian Basketball Superstar", "paragraphs": [{"context": "The world lost a basketball hero this week -- and we're not talking about Michael Jordan.

It is a development that was considered impossible just a few years ago. Researchers in New York City say a blind 62-year-old volunteer can now read large letters and navigate around big objects by using a tiny camera wired to computers and a platinum electrode implanted in his brain. John Girvin, a neurosurgery (brain surgery) professor in London, Ontario is the doctor who implanted the electrodes in the patient's brain at the New York Neurological Institute in 1979. It was part of an international research effort to develop artificial sight. Although the research began in 1970, it's taken all these years to develop computers small and powerful enough to process the camera images and send them to the brain. \"When we first did those experiments, it would have taken a room full of computers to process the image,\" says Girvin. \"Now it's small enough for him to carry around on a little pack.\" Although the research began in 1970, it's taken all these years to develop computers small and powerful enough to process the camera images and send them to the brain. \"When we first did those experiments, it would have taken a room full of computers to process the image,\" says Girvin. \"Now it's small enough for him to carry around on a little pack.\" Jerry - the name of the patient - doesn't see images. He perceives specks of light that appear and disappear as his field of vision shifts. But that was enough to help him locate a blackstocking cap hanging on a white wall and place it on the head of a mannequin in a recent demonstration. He also recognized a five-centimetre-tall letter from 1.5 metres away. The blind patient wears glasses with a tiny camera mounted on one lens and an ultrasonic rangefinder on the other. Both devices communicate with the small computer carried on the man's hip. The computer sends signals to small electrodes on the surface of Jerry's brain, using wires entering his skull behind his right ear. It looks like something you would see in a science fiction film. The electrodes stimulate certain brain cells, allowing Jerry to perceive the specks of light. Girvin said the artifician eye has \"great potential,\" but it's hard to predict how fast it can be perfected to something more like real sight. \"The technology is available now. Something could be done one with it in a very few years, but it would take an enormous amount of money and an enormous scientific team.\"", "qas": [{"question": "What do Jerry's glasses have on them?", "id": "2000-W03-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a tiny camera and an ultrasonic rangefinder", "answer_start": 314}]}, {"question": "When did Jerry get electrodes implanted in his brain?", "id": "2000-W03-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1979", "answer_start": 577}]}, {"question": "How old is Jerry?", "id": "2000-W03-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "62", "answer_start": 224}]}, {"question": "Who helped Jerry see?", "id": "2000-W03-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "John Girvin", "answer_start": 396}, {"text": "a Canadian brain surgeon", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "a neurosurgery (brain surgery) professor", "answer_start": 409}, {"text": "a neurosurgery (brain surgery) professor in London, Ontario", "answer_start": 409}, {"text": "a doctor", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "a computer", "answer_start": 0}]}, {"question": "Where does John Girvin work as a professor?", "id": "2000-W03-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "London, Ontario", "answer_start": 453}, {"text": "London", "answer_start": 453}, {"text": "Ontario", "answer_start": 461}]}]}]}, {"title": "Surgical Dummies", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Usually, a when doctors are being trained to perform operations, they learn by practising on real, live human patients -- something patients are not always happy about.

The two boys who carried this out belonged to a group of teenagers who called themselves the \"Trenchcoat Mafia.\" There are reports that a bomb exploded late Tuesday night as police tried to remove it. A spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department has said bomb squads may need several days to complete searching the school for explosives. There is as of right now no apparent reason for the shootings other than the boys have told schoolmates in the past that they felt they did not fit in. Their gang reportedly disliked minorities and athletes. Witnesses said the boys laughed as they methodically moved through the school shooting people at random.

American President Bill Clinton went on television yesterday to express his condolences to the families and friends of the victims. He said the challenge facing America is to teach its young people to resolve their problems with \"words not weapons.\" Clinton said he would have more to say on the issue of violence in the school system later this week.

This is happening because the coalition of countries that are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organizatoin (NATO) want to stop the Yugoslavians from invading the neighbouring region of Kosovo. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which is one of the republics that make up Yugoslavia. Ninety per cent of Kosovo's population are ethnic Albanians, who have been pushing for independence from Serbia. Brigadier-General Michel Maisonneuve is the senior Canadian Forces officer who has been serving with NATO. He adds that \"Kosovo is a beautiful part of Yugoslavia. It is relatively flat, with mountains surrounding it, as well as a spine that runs up the middle. The province is in large majority ethnic Albanian, with many other minorities, including Serbs, gypsies, Turks, etc. The people are hospitable and hardy.\" The conflict that is being played out today has roots that go back hundreds and hundreds of years. In 1389, Serbs lost a key battle against the forces of the invading Ottoman Empire on the fields of Kosovo. The defeat marks the beginning of the end of Serbia's Medieval Empire. Kosovo became part of the Ottoman Empire. In the following centuries that battle become the key event in Serbian and Albanian national history. Over the last decade there have been many attempts at a peaceful settlement. Representatives of the NATO countries have tried to negotiate with the government of Yugoslavia. Those negotions failed earlier this week. NATO says that bombing Yugoslavia is the only way to get them to stop their assault on Kosovo. The question is no longer if, but when, NATO will begin bombing. NATO Secretary General Javier Solana assured Yugoslovia's neighbours today that the alliance would protect them in the event of attacks by Yugoslavia. Yugoslav officials say they might not be able to win a war against NATO, but they feel they can inflict serious damage. NATO military planners aren't taking the threats lightly. Few people believe that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is ready to give in. He opposes outside interference in Kosovo. The Yugoslav leader insists the problems in Kosovo are an internal Yugoslav matter. He refuses to allow any outside force into Kosovo to monitor any peace agreement. If NATO strikes proceed, Canadians will be involved. There are about 130 Canadian Forces personnel and six CF-18 fighter aircraft based in Aviano, Italy who will likely participate.", "qas": [{"question": "What do the nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization want to stop the Yugoslavians from doing?", "id": "1999-W13-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "invading neighbouring Kosovo", "answer_start": 605}, {"text": "invading the neighbouring region of Kosovo", "answer_start": 605}]}, {"question": "What are the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo pushing for?", "id": "1999-W13-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "independence from Serbia", "answer_start": 823}]}, {"question": "How old are the roots of the conflict between Kosovo and Serbia?", "id": "1999-W13-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "hundreds and hundreds of years", "answer_start": 1332}]}, {"question": "When did the Serbs lose a key battle against the forces of the invading Ottoman Empire in Kosovo?", "id": "1999-W13-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1389", "answer_start": 1367}]}, {"question": "Where is the capital of Kosovo?", "id": "1999-W13-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Pristina", "answer_start": 57}]}, {"question": "Who is Slobodan Milosevic?", "id": "1999-W13-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Yugoslav President", "answer_start": 2416}, {"text": "President of Yugoslavia", "answer_start": 2425}]}, {"question": "How has Milosevic described the problems in Kosovo?", "id": "1999-W13-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "as an internal Yugoslav matter", "answer_start": 2573}]}, {"question": "What does Milosevic refuse to do?", "id": "1999-W13-3-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "he refuses to allow any outside force into Kosovo to monitor any peace agreement", "answer_start": 2602}]}, {"question": "What do Yugoslav officials feel they can do in a war against NATO?", "id": "1999-W13-3-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "inflict serious damage", "answer_start": 2310}]}, {"question": "How many Canadian Forces personnel are based in Aviano, Italy?", "id": "1999-W13-3-11", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "about 130", "answer_start": 2747}]}]}]}, {"title": "Canada's Newest Judge", "paragraphs": [{"context": "The woman who charged Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for war crimes has been appointed to Canada's Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is Canada's highest court. Louise Arbour will become the high court's third female justice when she begins her new job in September. Justice Minister Anne McLellan says the 52-year-old Arbour is perfect for the job and will replace retired justice Peter Cory quite nicely. Ms. McLellan says Judge Arbour will make sure the tribunal continues to pursue its cases against Milosevic and his fellow accused ministers. She says Judge Arbour's work prosecuting war crimes would enhance the Supreme Court, describing her as \"a woman who has dealt with some of the most difficult and challenging issues of our modern time. \"I think it is unquestioned that she will make a singular contribution to the highest court in the land.\" Judge Arbour's last major act as chief prosecutor was to indict Slobodan Milosevic for crimes against humanity two weeks ago -- the first time an international court has charged a sitting head of state with war crimes. She held the Yugoslav President personally responsible, along with four of his aides, for the horrors in Kosovo and the brutal purge of ethnic Albanians. It appears to be no coincidence that Ms. McLellan announced the appointment the day after NATO and Yugoslav generals signed a detailed military agreement on the withdrawal of Yugoslav and Serb forces from Kosovo. The government was very aware of how tricky it would be to take her away from her high-profile assignment of prosecuting Milosevic. Judge Arbour will not start work until September 15th. Judge Arbour is seen as having a sound knowledge of the law, coupled with an understanding of the practical implications that judgments have on people. Her multitude of friends describe her as legally brilliant, charming, and possessed of a common touch. \"Louise Arbour is a down-to-earth individual, who understands the needs of the ordinary person,\" says lawyer Earl Levy. Judge Arbour graduated from the University of Montreal with a law degree in 1970. In 1995, she headed an inquiry into the mistreatment of women in the Prison for Women in Kingston, Ontario.

Premier Harris says it was the hardest-fought campaign in recent memory. Yesterday the Conservatives won 59 seats in the Ontario legislature. That means representatives of their party won in 59 \"ridings\" -- small political regions across the province. The Liberals led by Dalton McGuinty got 35 seats, and the New Democratic Party under leader Howard Hampton took nine seats. In Ontario's new 103-seat legislature, the Tories needed 52 seats for a majority government -- a government where they control more than half the seats. They got 8 more than that. A majority government makes it much easier for the ruling party to make decisions, because they get more than half of the votes on any issue. The Premier says he will now push ahead with following through on his campaign promises. They included things like cutting taxes, testing teachers, and cracking down on panhandlers and squeegee kids. It's the first time in 32 years that any party has won two majority governments in a row in Ontario. \"Four years ago you sent me to do a job, you placed your faith in our team, in our plan, and we have done our very best to implement that plan and keep your faith,\" Premier Harris told cheering supporters in North Bay. \"There is a new pride in Ontario. Our economy is back on track... faith in our future has been restored.\" Premier Harris was attacked during the campaign as leading a mean-spirited government, and for being a man who refused to compromise. During the campaign, he was hounded by protesters at every appearance. Election day began with a controversy, as polls did not open on time in several ridings. Several returning officers (the people in charge of a polling station) called in sick. In some cases, ballot boxes did not arrive on time and in other cases, problems with the voters list caused long line-ups. The problems forced Ontario's chief elections officer, Warren Baillie, to keep some polls open until as late as 11:00 pm.

They set off this week on foot and by camel on a grueling trek across the burning Arabian desert. When they were still in Canada, planning their trip, they expected they would feel lonely. But after two days into the 1,200 kilometre journey, the caravan has won celebrity status among the native Bedouin people and government officials of Oman. Some have excitedly tagged along, says expedition leader Jamie Clarke. Mr. Clarke is making the trek with his older brother Leigh and their friend Bruce Kirby. They have hired three  guides. They are now in the Omani city of Solalah on the Arabian Sea. The group was forced to return briefly to replace some broken equipment, notably camel saddles, 40 kilometres into the odyssey. The adventurers expect to travel for up to 55 days through the scorching heat and towering dunes of Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. They are attempting to become the first Westerners in more than 50 years to cross the Empty Quarter of Arabia, the world's largest sand desert. Mr. Clarke has adventure in his blood. He scaled Mount Everest in the Himalayas in 1997. Now he and his companions are following a famous route taken by British adventurer Sir Wilfred Thesiger in 1947. They are journeying through the harsh and mostly uninhabited desert wearing the clothes and eating the food that is traditional for the nomadic Bedouin people. \"It's quite an event here to have us crossing the desert in such a traditional fashion and in the footsteps of Thesiger,\" Mr. Clarke says. \"So, our team can be anywhere from our six normal members on up to quadruple that size at night when people walk into camp or walk along with us to cheer us on.\" The site of the expedition's camp Wednesday was the Ayoon pools, north of Solalah, where temperatures during the day rise to 45 degrees Celsius  and fall at night to as low as 3 degrees Celsius. The start of the trip was delayed because of technical problems with communications equipment for use in emergencies and because of stomach problems after Clarke had his first taste of the Bedouin delicacy of goat brains. \"When the Bedouin cook, they are accustomed to using all of the animal. Every edible piece of the creature is in the pot, among them are some of the unsavory stuff like brains,\" Mr. Clarke says. \"I'm keen to try everything and sometimes it just doesn't agree. A little nausea, throwing up and diarrhea shouldn't hold somebody back.\" Mr. Clarke and his companions met with Mr. Thesiger, who is now 88, in London, England on their way to the Middle East from Canada. Mr. Thesiger's book Arabian Sands told the story of his 1947 trek. Among Mr. Thesiger's words of advice for the trio was to take great care of the camels because their lives depend on the very stubborn animals as transportation for themselves and their provisions. \"I don't think we really understood the magnitude of that statement, which is so simple and obvious. Yet in the first two weeks of our training here and the first two days of our journey, it's incredible how powerful that statement is,\" Mr. Clarke says. From Solalah, the route will take the group through Saudi Arabia and the trek will finish in Abu Dhabi. Along the way the party must cross the Uruq al Shaiba range of mountainous dunes, pass by the quicksand of Umm al Samim (Mother of Poison) and hike across a 185-mile stretch that has no water supply.", "qas": [{"question": "How long has it been since Westerners crossed the world's largest sand desert?", "id": "1999-W06-4-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "more than 50 years", "answer_start": 1010}]}, {"question": "Who are the nomadic natives of Oman?", "id": "1999-W06-4-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the Bedouin", "answer_start": 2143}]}, {"question": "What three countries will the Canadians cross through on their desert trek?", "id": "1999-W06-4-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Oman, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates", "answer_start": 930}]}, {"question": "What is \"Arabian Sands\" about?", "id": "1999-W06-4-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Sir Wilfred Thesiger's 1947 trek", "answer_start": 1272}]}, {"question": "What advice did Mr. Thesiger give to the Canadians?", "id": "1999-W06-4-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "take great care of the camels", "answer_start": 2769}]}, {"question": "At what point did the group have to return to replace broken camel saddles?", "id": "1999-W06-4-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "40 kilometres into the odyssey", "answer_start": 775}]}, {"question": "What type of clothing are the Canadians wearing on their journey across the desert?", "id": "1999-W06-4-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the traditional clothing of the Bedouin people", "answer_start": 2140}, {"text": "traditional Bedouin clothing", "answer_start": 1418}]}, {"question": "When did Clarke climb Mount Everest?", "id": "1999-W06-4-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1997", "answer_start": 1183}]}, {"question": "Where will the trio's journey end?", "id": "1999-W06-4-11", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Abu Dhabi", "answer_start": 3257}]}]}]}, {"title": "A Prairie Haven for Kosovo Refugees", "paragraphs": [{"context": "A month after fleeing battered and bloodied Kosovo, Yugoslavia with nothing but the clothes on their backs, Qemal Sefa and his family arrived at their new home in Winnipeg, Manitoba last night. Looking tired and anxious after days of travel, Sefa, his wife and four grown children greeted members of their extended family - many of whom they had never met - at the airport with shy smiles, hugs and kisses. Speaking through an interpreter, Sefa said he was happy to finally be in Winnipeg and offered his thanks to the Canadian people for opening their doors to him and his family. The six ethnic Albanian refugees - the first to make their way to Western Canada - will be staying with Sefa's brother Esat and his son Haki. \"This last month has been rough,\" Sefa said. \"We were not happy to leave our home, but we are glad to be here and safe.\" A month ago, Sefa, 59, and his family were given less than five minutes to leave their home in the town of Gjakov by Serb forces who ordered them out of Kosovo. The family took no clothes, mementos or household items with them and walked about seven kilometres to the Albanian border. While most of Sefa's family made the trip to the Albanian capital of Tirana safely, his youngest son, Orland, 23, never showed up. \"We don't know if he's alive or dead,\" Sefa said. Esat Sefa said he has been wanting to bring his family to Canada ever since fighting erupted in Kosovo. He said he often tried to send money and supplies to them but shipments were regularly intercepted by Serb forces who kept the money and goods for themselves. Sefa and his family will receive support from the federal government for up to two years, during which time they can apply to stay in Canada permanently. But Sefa - who recently retired from his job at a theatre after 45 years - said last night it may not take that long for him to decide where to make his new home. \"Maybe we stay here,\" he said as his wife gestured with a nod. Another 10 Albanian refugees will head north to Thompson, Manitoba today to be reunited with family members there. Ninety more refugees with relatives in Manitoba are expected to make their way to the province over the next month. At least 700 more ethnic Albanian refugees are expected in the coming weeks. Hundreds of thousands of refugees are now living in camps just outside of Yugoslavia. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees says those camps are almost full. Aid workers are doing their best to shepherd the refugees to camps that have space. Canada originally planned to take in 5,000 refugees and house them at Canadian Forces bases. But the UN decided it would be better to keep refugees closer to home to ease their return when the war ends. NEWS FLASH The federal government has reopened its plan to airlift 5,000 Kosovo Albanians to refuge in Canada. Canada put the airlift on hold three weeks ago when the UN decided it was better to keep ethnic Albanians driven from Kosovo by Serbian forces close to home. At that time, the UN figured it would be easier to resettle them when a peace deal is reached with Yugoslavia. Immigration Minister Lucienne Robillard says she was asked today to \"reactivate\" the plan by the United Nations agency responsible for refugees. And Ms. Robillard responded that Canada will do so. The minister says the refugees will begin arriving Monday. Ms. Robillard says 300 people a day will be airlifted to Canada for about two weeks.", "qas": [{"question": "When did Qemal Sefa's family flee Kosovo?", "id": "1999-W18-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a month ago", "answer_start": 845}]}, {"question": "How did Sefa's family reach the Albanian border?", "id": "1999-W18-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "walked", "answer_start": 1076}]}, {"question": "How far did Sefa's family live from the Albanian border?", "id": "1999-W18-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "7 kilometers", "answer_start": 2194}]}, {"question": "Where did Qemal Sefa use to work?", "id": "1999-W18-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "at a theatre", "answer_start": 1773}]}, {"question": "How old is Qemal Sefa?", "id": "1999-W18-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "59", "answer_start": 864}]}, {"question": "What happened to the money and supplies Esat tried to send to his brother's family?", "id": "1999-W18-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "they were regularly intercepted by Serb forces who kept the money and goods for themselves", "answer_start": 1487}, {"text": "intercepted by Serb forces", "answer_start": 1502}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the UN organization responsible for refugees?", "id": "1999-W18-5-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "The United Nations High Commission for Refugees", "answer_start": 2348}]}]}]}, {"title": "Tibetan Flag Removed During Chinese Premier's Visit", "paragraphs": [{"context": "The mayor of Saint John's, Newfoundland lowered the flag of China's troubled Tibetan territory following reports that Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji wasn't amused.

It was the beginning of a six-day, six-city Canadian tour that will emphasize trade and environmental issues. The premier arrived in Canada after wrapping up a nine-day visit to the United States. China's record on human rights often dogged Zhu during the U.S. leg of his trip and is expected to follow him north. Zhu, accompanied by a delegation of about 150 people, was greeted by Newfoundland Premier Brian Tobin. About 120 Chinese , many of them school-age children or students at Memorial University, also turned out to wave Chinese and Canadian flags and shout greetings. A banner read \"Warmly welcome Premier Zhu Rongji to visit Canada.\" On Tuesday, Wells granted a local group permission to fly the Tibetan flag at City Hall for the duration of Mr. Zhu's visit as a show of protest against the country's human rights record. In Ottawa, Sean Rowan, a spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs, confirmed the Chinese delegation complained about the flying of the Tibetan flag. He said federal officials explained that Canada is a free country and that flying the flag was a decision of the City of Saint John's and in no way represented Ottawa's policy. Rowan said the Chinese concerns were passed on to provincial officials just the same. Wells said he will not present Zhu with the keys to the city, a tradition usually accorded visiting dignitaries. It's just one small protest to remind the Canadian government that not all Canadians support pandering to China for business contracts,\" said Wells, who is a member of Amnesty International. \"Some people believe that human rights is not just a western custom.\" He also said Calgary, Alberta Mayor Al Duerr's decision to present a white cowboy hat, Calgary's symbol of hospitality, to Zhu was \"shameful\" and \"unacceptable.\" Duerr shrugged off the criticism. \"It's easy to throw stones when you're sitting on a rock,\" he said, adding the white hat has nothing to do with politics. \"When the white hat becomes a political symbol, we will stop giving it out.\" Canadian activists, meanwhile, want Prime Minister Jean Chretien to speak out forcefully when the politically-powerful Zhu arrives in Ottawa, Ontario later today. James Pilgram of the Canada-Tibet Committee said flying the Tibetan flag in Saint John's was meant to be a peaceful sign of protest. After Tibet's failed 1959 uprising against the Chinese, the Dalai Lama and 120,000 followers fled their Himalayan homes for what has become a lifelong exile, mostly in India and Nepal. There are smaller Tibetan communities in Switzerland, the United States and Canada. China effectively annexed Tibet after the revolt and declared it a Chinese province. Several demonstrations cantering around the Tibet issue occurred during Zhu's U.S. visit. During a protest earlier Wednesday in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a flag-waving pro-Chinese demonstrator was knocked down after he got close to a group of about 100 pro-Tibet protesters who were chanting \"Shame on China.\" The protesters grabbed the flag from the man and burned it. Following a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Zhu responded to questions about a prominent dissident by saying human rights in China have improved. He acknowledged some shortcomings, however. \"We wish to establish a nation which is ruled in accordance with law,\" he said. \"As for any individual case, I don't think this is the appropriate time to go into details.\" Before leaving for Ottawa Thursday, Zhu met with Tobin and his cabinet.

The build-up of these chemicals makes eating Arctic fish and game a frightening and tricky business. The issue came to a head recently as both Canadian aboriginal and federal delegates attended a United Nations conference in Africa. They were seeking to bring attention to the negative effects of globally-produced chemical contaminants on the Arctic food chain. Carole Mills works with the problem daily, both in the contaminants division of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, and as a representative of the Canadian Arctic Indigenous Peoples Against POPs. \"POPS\" are persistent organic pollutants. \"The contamination of animals is confusing and sometimes even alarming, and even my own family members have sometimes stopped eating fish until I could talk to them and explain that the contaminants do concentrate in specific parts, so you don't have to stop eating the animals,\" she says. Ms. Mills says the concentration of chemical pollutants in marine Mammals increases as its position in the food chain gets higher. So micro-organisms carry little contamination; the fish that eat them carry slightly more, and the build-up continues through the chain to include predatory fish, seals, walruses, whales and polar bears and, lastly, humans. Ms. Mills says land-based animals like caribou are very clean. She says it is only the organs and fat of marine mammals that concerned individuals might want to avoid. She says concentrations are bound to be higher in muktuk, a dish made from seal, walrus or whale fat. Ultimately, Ms. Mills stresses a calm, sensible approach.

It's an example of a school teaming up with the community to raise money. South Queens Junior High School is taking aim at the fitness market. The school has turned its one-time metal shop - lost to budget cuts almost two years ago - into a money-making professional fitness club. The club will be open seven days a week. The club, operated by a non-profit society made up of school and community volunteers, has sold more than 30 memberships and hired a full-time co-ordinator. Principal Betty Jean Aucoin says the club is a first for a Nova Scotia public school. She says the school took it on itself to provide a service needed in Liverpool. \"We don't have any athletic facilities here on the South Shore of Nova Scotia, so if we don't use our schools, communities such as Queens are going to be struggling to get anything going,\" Aucoin said. More than a $100,000 was raised through fund-raising and donations from government, Sport Nova Scotia, and two local companies. Some people are wondering if the ties between the businesses and the school are too close. Schools are not set up to make profits or promote businesses. Southwest Regional School Board superintendent Ann Jones says there's no fear the lines between education and business are blurring. \"First call on any school facility belongs to... the youngsters in the school,\" says Ann Jones. The 12,000-square-foot club has seven aerobic machines, including treadmills, steppers, and stationary bicycles, as well as weight machines and freeweights.

All use of marijuana is now illegal in Canada. But if a scientific study of the drug shows that it can help relieve pain in some people, it could be legalized for medical use only. Marijuana is the common name of Cannabis sativa, a plant which contains more than 400 chemicals. What is commonly referred to as marijuana (\"grass\", \"pot\", \"weed\") in North America is usually made up of crushed cannabis leaves, flowers, and often twigs. Health Minister Allan Rock announced yesterday that his department is putting together guidelines for a scientific look at marijuana. The study would examine how the drug should be administered, and how a safe supply could be distributed to patients. \"There are people who are dying,\" Mr. Rock said. \"They want access to something they believe will help with their symptoms. We want to help.\" The Health Department has already consulted with the Food and Drug Administration in the United States -- which is also planning similar trials -- about acquiring marijuana for the tests. Making marijuana available to patients by prescription will not mean changes to the criminal code. Marijuana could be administered under an existing section of the Food and Drug Act, which allows for special access to prohibited substances. The belief that marijuana eases pain in some patients has been growing -- although people continue to face criminal charges across Canada even when they claim to be using it for medical purposes. THC (delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol) is the main psychoactive part of marijuana. When marijuana is smoked, THC is absorbed from the lungs to the bloodstream within minutes. Mark Crossley is a 38-year-old Nova Scotia man with an inoperable brain tumour.  He was sentenced last week to four months of house arrest and 18 months probation for growing marijuana in his backyard. He said he received the sentence even after the court was told he smoked the drug to deal with the painful headaches and appetite loss caused by his cancer. His doctor approved. Mr. Rock said his announcement is not a step toward a widespread legalization of the drug. \"This has nothing to do with legalizing marijuana,\" he said. But he added, \"I think Canadians support on a compassionate basis, if someone is dying, access to a substance that could alleviate their suffering.\" An Edmonton doctor who specializes in pain management agrees with the federal government's move.  Doctor Helen Hays studied a patient who smoked marijuana to fight the symptoms of a painful muscle disorder. \"There was a tremendous improvement,\" she said. She also says that smoking marijuana brings its own side effects and doesn't work for everyone. \"We all need to know an awful lot more about it.\" Doctors can currently prescribe a synthetic form of marijuana, but it is expensive, and many patients complain that oral forms of the drug don't work as well as smoking it. Several American states have already approved the medical use of marijuana. It was taken to a vote in seven U.S. states and the District of Columbia.

The former British colony formally joined confederation on March 31, 1949 -- 82 years after Canada became a country. Some Newfoundlanders marked the occasion by re-creating the vote that brought the province into Canada. The town of Saint Anthony staged a referendum during the last 10 days but with a different result than that of half a century ago. This time the \"No\" side won by a slim margin. Of the 934 people who cast ballots, 53 per cent opposed joining Canada. In fact, the referendum also mirrors history. The first time Newfoundlanders voted in 1948 they rejected union with Canada. It was only in the second vote that Newfoundlanders said \"yes\". It's a result many Newfoundlanders and their politicians have wondered about over the years. Where would Newfoundland be today if the referendum results had been reversed and 52 per cent of voters chose independence? Newfoundlander John Crosbie was a minister in the Conservative government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.  He thinks the province may have been all right on its own. \"It is highly likely we would have survived,\" Crosbie said. \"It would have been a lot more work and more difficult, but it wouldn't have been necessarily a disaster had we continued as an independent dominion.\" But Mr. Crosbie does recognize the benefits of the union. \"Our quality of life is better here today because people have a basic level of security,\" he says. Mr. Crosbie says a number of federal government programs like unemployment insurance and aid packages to fishers who are out of work are just a few of the reasons Newfoundlanders should count their blessings. Newfoundland was granted full British colonial status in the early 19th century. The Royal Navy began escorting ships to the Grand Banks fishing grounds for the summer fishing season and soon developed seasonal communities along the coast. As permanent settlements formed, civil governors replaced fishing admirals and colonial political institutions were set up. Newfoundland s first popularly elected legislative assembly convened in Saint John s in 1832. In the decades that followed, the colony was run by representative government, and later, responsible government in 1855. The population was also strongly divided by religion -- half were Protestant, half Roman Catholic. By the turn of the century, Newfoundland was a self-governing colony that played a small role in international affairs. But life in small communities dotting the coast -- called outports -- was rough. Poverty, starvation and disease were rampant. By the end of the Second World War, union with Canada was once again being mentioned. Newfoundlanders were swept up in a passionate debate between a pro-union movement called the Confederates and an anti-union movement that wanted Newfoundland to have what was called \"responsible government\", that is, to remain independent from Canada. A vote was held on July 22, 1948. On the morning of July 23, 1948, Newfoundlanders awoke to hear that the Confederates had won. It was a tight race: the pro-confederates received 52.3 per cent of the vote with responsible government getting 47.7 per cent. Newfoundland was on its way to becoming Canada s tenth province. A gala concert caps Newfoundland's celebrations this evening with guests on both sides of the unity debate.

Wang Shui-Bo is nominated for an Oscar for Best Short Documentary for his half-hour film \"Sunrise over Tiananmen Square.\" The film is a Wang's perspective on the events that led up to June 4, 1989, when Chinese government troops opened fire on student demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Wang traces his personal journey through a collage of original artwork mixed with family and archival photographs.  It's a journey that begins with Wang as a loyal Communist, full of the political idealism common in China under the early years of leader Mao Tse Tung. It ends with him as an anti-government activist willing to risk his life to uphold the first stirrings of democracy. \"Sunrise over Tiananmen Square\" shows how the dream starts to fade during the Cultural Revolution in the '60s and '70s, when the Red Guards attack and destroy anything linked to the old Chinese culture. And how the dream is crushed when the tanks roll in Tiananmen Square. Wang fled China after the student uprising and now lives in Montreal, Quebec.  But he was in Beijing when he learned of his Oscar nomination. Even today his film can't be shown in China. But Wang hopes that one day that will change, and explosive subjects such as the Tiananmen Square massacre will no longer be taboo.

We have suffered so much since 100 years ago.\" \"It's time to enjoy life,\" Wang says.

He would make it available to charities to raise money, and would let individual major league teams display it. And what would he like in return? \"I d like to be able to take 20 swings in every major league ball park,\" he says. Mr. McFarlane, who owns autographs from Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, says purchasing the ball was cheaper than buying a sports team. In all, McFarlane bought nine home run balls hit by McGwire and Sammy Sosa, including McGwires, 63rd, 67th, 68th and 69th, and Sosa s 33rd (his record 20th in June), 61st and 66th. Mr. McFarlane bought the ball at auction January 12, paying more than $3 million Canadian to Philip Ozersky. The research scientist caught the ball September 27 at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri. Sammy Sosa s final home run of the season, No. 66, cost Mr. McFarlane about $250,000 Canadian.  All the  others he bought at the auction cost under $20,000 apiece. \"I blew my life savings on this,\" McFarlane says. \"I m not like the American billionaire Donald Trump. I don t have a lot of cash.\" The group of balls will be called The McFarlane Collection. \"Given that I name all my corporations after myself, I ll name it after myself,\" he said. \"Better than  The Guy Who Has More Money Than Brains Collection.  \" Source: The Canadian Press, CBC News", "qas": [{"question": "Where is Todd McFarlane originally from?", "id": "1999-W07-2-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Calgary", "answer_start": 482}]}, {"question": "How old is Todd McFarlane?", "id": "1999-W07-2-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "37", "answer_start": 470}]}, {"question": "When did Todd McFarlane buy Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball?", "id": "1999-W07-2-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "January 12, 1999", "answer_start": 1906}]}, {"question": "How many historic baseballs does McFarlane now own?", "id": "1999-W07-2-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "9", "answer_start": 911}, {"text": "nine", "answer_start": 982}]}, {"question": "What does McFarlane want in return for making the \"McFarlane Collection\" available to places like the National Baseball Hall of Fame?", "id": "1999-W07-2-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "to take 20 swings in every major league ball park", "answer_start": 1493}]}, {"question": "Whose ball did McFarlane buy for about $250,000 Canadian dollars?", "id": "1999-W07-2-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Sammy Sosa's final home run of the season, No. 66", "answer_start": 2080}]}, {"question": "How often is there a Toy Fair in New York?", "id": "1999-W07-2-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "yearly", "answer_start": 674}]}]}]}, {"title": "Controversial School Television", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Television is behind a growing controversy in a Mississauga, Ontario high school. And it's got nothing to do with what students are watching in their spare time at home. It's about teens having to watch commercials in school. Every day. It's a controversy about the growing commercialization of schools. Youth News Network, a private news and current-affairs network, has installed a satellite dish and thousands of dollars worth of televisions and audio-visual equipment at Meadowvale Secondary School free of charge. It expects to start broadcasting its 12-minute newscast -- complete with 2 1/2 minutes of commercials -- every day to the school's 1,700 students starting in September. But along with the bonanza of technology, the school is inheriting a political hot potato. \"I happen to believe that it is completely unacceptable to sell off little bits of our kids,\" said Heather-Jane Robertson, director of professional development with the Canadian Teachers Federation. \"If we don't understand that it's wrong to sell off our kids to advertisers, to compromise public education in that way, then we can hardly turn around and blame the people who want to make money off our stupidity.\" Some educators say YNN serves as an example of the wave of commercialization sweeping over schools at a time when funding cuts are forcing public boards to look to businesses for help. While public broadcasters such as CBC Newsworld and TV Ontario provide programming free of charge to schools, none can come close to providing the wealth of televisions, VCRs, computers, and video cameras installed at Meadowvale under its pilot project with YNN's owner, Montreal-based Athena Educational Partners Inc. Meadowvale principal Laurie Pedwell conceded that the technology was part of YNN's appeal. But she insisted that the sample broadcast viewed by students last November was balanced and suitably tailored to teenagers. As for the advertisements, she said none was offensive or aggressively pushing a product, and most depicted teenagers positively. The school has a June deadline to decide whether it wants to sign a five-year contract with YNN. Stephanie Lake is a grade twelve student at Meadowvale secondary. She recently wrote this essay about YNN coming to her school. \"We may be teenagers, but we're not all couch potatoes!  Well, at least we weren't. Who knows, maybe one day soon, secondary school students all across Canada will be the same - walking, brainwashed zombies.  The blame for this can be placed squarely on the shoulders of YNN and the governors of our education system. Trust the government. I don't think so! I am upset with the administration of my school for using us, the students, as guinea pigs, in a test which uses televisions inappropriately in my school.

If the river does overflow, thousands of people would have to leave their homes and hundreds of square kilometres of farmland would be under water. Early settlers recognized the potential of the fertile soils along the Fraser for growing food. Busy harbours and towns grew nearby because of easy access to inland and marine transportation routes. This intensely used river is home to five deep-sea port facilities, a ferry terminal, several fishing boat basins and numerous marinas and floating homes. Over 200 companies, including several large woodand fish processing facilities operate on or near the Fraser. It also accommodates the largest log booming grounds in the world. The Fraser River is the largest river in British Columbia, over 1378 kilometres. long. Its headwaters are at Mount Robson in Jasper National Park. The drainage of the entire river basin (watershed) is nearly one quarter of a million square kilometers -- larger than the area of Great Britain. The flood of 1948, the last major flood in the Lower British Columbia Mainland, flooded the area with almost 8 metres of water, just 80 kilometres from Vancouver. The 1948 flood claimed 10 lives, destroyed or damaged 2,300 homes and caused $20 million in damage -- about $140 million in current dollars. Total water flows in the Fraser River this spring are predicted to reach 94 per cent of 1948 flood levels. Although some dikes have been improved, the potential for disaster lingers if further prevention measures aren't taken, provincial officials said yesterday. The worst flood in the area's history was in 1894, when water levels reached 7.92 metres. A federal-provincial Fraser River flood-control program has rebuilt about 250 kilometres of dikes to withhold water levels as high as those in the 1894 flood. But officials say an estimated 150 kilometres of dikes in the Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley could not hold back that much water. Should high-water levels persist for abut two weeks, the dikes would be at serious risk of becoming saturated and breaching (breaking), or allowing seepage to escape through the soil and bubble up around homes and buildings. \"This can be quite dangerous if not controlled,\" says Environment Ministry spokesman Neil Peters. \"There is always the possibility the dike could fail.\" Ultimately, the water levels depend on the weather. If the snow melts gradually, there would probably be high, but safe, water levels. A very rapid melt could result in major flooding. \"The worst-case scenario is a month of scorching weather,\" Peters said. \"We would approach 1948 or 1894 levels.\" River levels are unlikely to peak before mid-May at earliest, and the peak flows might not occur until late June. Even if 1894 river levels aren't reached this spring, it's just a matter of time before they are, Peters says. \"We know this flood will occur sooner or later.\"", "qas": [{"question": "Where is the Fraser River?", "id": "1999-W16-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "British Columbia", "answer_start": 37}]}, {"question": "What are the fertile soils of the Fraser River good for?", "id": "1999-W16-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "growing food", "answer_start": 420}]}, {"question": "How large is the Fraser River watershed?", "id": "1999-W16-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "nearly one quarter of a million square kilometers", "answer_start": 1070}, {"text": "larger than the area of Great Britain", "answer_start": 1123}]}, {"question": "When will the river probably reach its highest level this year?", "id": "1999-W16-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "mid-May at earliest, and the peak flows might not occur until late June", "answer_start": 2828}, {"text": "mid-May to late June", "answer_start": 2828}]}, {"question": "How deep were the flood waters in 1948?", "id": "1999-W16-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "8 metres", "answer_start": 1271}]}, {"question": "How many people died in the 1948 flood?", "id": "1999-W16-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "10", "answer_start": 1348}]}, {"question": "Who is the Environment Ministry spokesman quoted in this story?", "id": "1999-W16-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Neil Peters", "answer_start": 2421}]}]}]}, {"title": "Julie At Work", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Over the weekend Canadian astronaut Julie Payette did not get a lot of time to put on her red clown nose and listen to the Sarah McLaughlan CD she brought along. She's been too busy getting the new International Space Station ready. Though it was cold and noisy, space shuttle Discovery astronauts were overjoyed over the weekend when they swung open the hatches to the International Space Station. Shuttle commander Kent Rominger likened the visit to checking in to a \"fantastic hotel,\" with one major exception: \"Right now there's not a space toilet on board, so that makes living here permanently kind of tough.\" Astronaut Tamara Jernigan and Russian crewmate Valery Tokarev led the way inside the unfinished station yesterday evening. \"We are absolutely delighted to be aboard,\" Ms. Jernigan said as she and Mr. Tokarev floated aboard. \"Make yourself at home,\" Mission Control told the seven-member crew. But their welcome quickly gave way to work early today. Inside the Russian-built Zarya control module, Valery Tokarev and Canadian astronaut Julie Payette pulled up the floor and began changing electrical meters on batteries that aren't charging properly. Astronauts Rick Husband and Daniel Barry replaced two electronics boxes for a communication system inside the American Unity chamber, where it was a brisk 14 degrees. The system, which allows ground controllers to transmit and receive commands from the station, had been broken since mid-April but fired up quickly once the repairs were made. \"Your hard work has paid off!\" Mission Control radioed up. \"Well that's super news,\" Mr. Husband replied. Earlier, the crew installed insulation around some fans inside Zarya to reduce the noise level, which Mr. Barry said measured up to 67 decibels. Station officials hoped the mufflers would reduce the noise level to about 60 decibels -- about the same as an office environment. \"It is a little bit noisy in there.\" The National Aeronautics and Space Administration downplayed the multitude of problems coming so soon after the space station's launch. \"In high-tech like this, you're going to have that happen,\" Mission Control's Milt Heflin explains.

Well, that is exactly what the federal government is doing concerning a million dollar gift to the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, Ontario.  And it appears the government does not like what it has found. To continue the metaphor, it look like this horse has some major dental problems. The government has been looking at a charitable donation by Ottawa Senators hockey star Alexi Yashin. Earlier this year he promised to give one million dollars to the National Arts Centre, a concert hall where people go to see plays and dance and to hear live music. Many Canadians were delighted to see that Alexi Yashin was donating so much money. Mr. Yashin makes a salary of more than three million dollars a season. It is very expensive to put on live performances and the National Arts Centre has recently had to raise ticket prices and cut back on performances because of a lack of funds. It was the most famous donation ever to the National Arts Centre. Mr. Yashin's popularity soared. But then this week Mr. Yashin's donation turned sour. After giving the Centre $200,000 Alexi Yashin made an about face. He decided not to give the other $800,000 he had promised. He says his decision was for personal reasons. But it now looks like Alexi Yashin was not really being honest. It seems he actually changed his mind because federal Auditor General Denis Desautels told him he was trying to break the law. Mr. Yashin originally announced he was a lover of the arts. He said that as a well paid hockey player he wanted to help the National Arts Centre put on new performances. But behind the scenes his plan was not to give the Arts Centre one million dollars. Instead, in a secret agreement, the National Arts Centre would have hired Mr. Yashin's parents at $85,000 a year. They would have been paid out of Alexi Yashin's yearly $200,000 donation. What's more, his parents would not have to actually work. This was a way for Alexi Yashin to give money to his parents while illegally saving thousands of dollars in taxes. As well, a lawyer working for Mr. Yashin was to get $15,000 out of the remaining $115,000. So in fact the million dollar donation would really only be half of that. It would have been a great public relations victory. Mr. Yashin would look like he was being very generous. But behind the scenes he was really much less so. Yesterday evening the Ottawa Senators were playing in Boston. After the game reporters went to the locker room to ask Alexi Yashin what was going on. But he refused to talk to reporters about his \"personal reasons\" for cancelling his donation. He said simply that \"I know I didn't do anything illegal. I know I didn't do anything wrong. I can't control what they say. It's a free country.\" He also said he wanted to focus on hockey and nothing else. The other players and coach of the Ottawa Senators would not comment either. They said it was Alexi's personal affair and not important to them. Many Ottawa-area hockey fans are deeply disappointed with what is going on. \"People here are puzzled. They feel let down,\" says Rick Soweita, who owns a sports bar. \"He benefited from the publicity and now he's got to own up.\"", "qas": [{"question": "How much does Alexi Yashin earn as a hockey player?", "id": "1999-W04-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "more than three million dollars a season", "answer_start": 794}]}, {"question": "Who does Alexi Yashin play for?", "id": "1999-W04-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Ottawa Senators", "answer_start": 475}]}, {"question": "How much money did Alexi Yashin actually donate to the National Arts Centre?", "id": "1999-W04-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "$200,000", "answer_start": 1187}]}, {"question": "Why do people go to the National Arts Centre?", "id": "1999-W04-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "to see plays and dance and to hear live music", "answer_start": 635}]}, {"question": "How would Alexi's parents have benefited from his donation to the National Arts Centre?", "id": "1999-W04-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "they would earn $85,000 a year ", "answer_start": 1894}, {"text": "the National Arts Centre would have hired them at $85,000 a year", "answer_start": 1812}]}, {"question": "Where did reporters question Alexi Yashin?", "id": "1999-W04-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "in the locker room", "answer_start": 51}, {"text": "Boston", "answer_start": 2518}]}]}]}, {"title": "When Did the First People Arrive?", "paragraphs": [{"context": "When native Canadians tell you their family has been living here for a long time, you'd better believe them, say a growing number of archeologists. Try 40,000 years, to be precise. New research suggests that's how long people have inhabited the Yukon. That is tens of thousands of years earlier than originally thought. The previously accepted theory about the populating of North America was that the first inhabitants crossed a land bridge from Asia into what is now Alaska roughly 10,000 to 11,000 years ago, after the last Ice Age. Since the 1960s, scientists have pointed to \"Clovis points\" - 10,000 to 11,000-year-old stone tools found throughout much of unglaciated North America. But recently, scientists have suggested that the region known as Eastern Beringia, now in the eastern Yukon, could have been inhabited at least as far back as 25,000 years ago. Some researchers think habitation of the Americas dates back even further. \"My view is that there is no question that there were people in Eastern Beringia 40,000 years ago, and this view has to be taken into serious consideration if you want to discuss the peopling of the New World,\" says Jacques Cinq-Mars, an archeologist at the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Ottawa. At that time, during an ice age, much of North America sat under a kilometre-thick slab of glacial ice. But the Beringia area, which stretched from Siberia across Alaska and Yukon and into the Northwest Territories, remained ice-free. The latest evidence supporting the earlier dates was found in the Bluefish Caves, on the Bluefish River about 50 kilometres southeast of Old Crow. Archeologists found in the caves a mammoth bone that was probably flaked and shaped by human hands roughly 23,500 years ago. The caves also contained hundreds of bones from at least 18 species of migratory birds. The bones are anywhere from 10,000 to 25,000 years old. Many of the bird bones also show human-made cut marks. Mr. Cinq-Mars believes the caves were likely used by hunters over a period of roughly 15,000 years. The Bluefish Caves were re-discovered by Mr. Cinq-Mars in 1975. He led a research team that excavated the caves 1978 and 1987. The team's findings are showcased at the Beringia Interpretive Centre on the Alaska Highway. Heather Pringle is the author of In Search of Ancient North America, part of which is about the Bluefish Caves in northern Yukon. She says that \"most people still think of archeologists as wild guys in jungles looking for priceless artifacts to go in a museum. It seems to me archeology is much more about uncovering the lives of ancient people.\"", "qas": [{"question": "How long have people inhabited the Yukon region, according to new research?", "id": "1999-W19-1-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "40,000 years", "answer_start": 152}]}, {"question": "How did the first inhabitants of North America get here?", "id": "1999-W19-1-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "crossed a land bridge from Asia into what is now Alaska", "answer_start": 420}, {"text": "crossed a land bridge", "answer_start": 420}]}, {"question": "Where is Eastern Beringia?", "id": "1999-W19-1-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "eastern Yukon", "answer_start": 782}]}, {"question": "Who says \"there is no question that there were people in Eastern Beringia 40,000 years ago\"?", "id": "1999-W19-1-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Jacques Cinq-Mars, an archeologist at the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Ottawa", "answer_start": 1156}, {"text": "Jacques Cinq-Mars", "answer_start": 1156}]}, {"question": "Where was the latest evidence supporting earlier dates for the first human inhabitants of North America found?", "id": "1999-W19-1-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "in the Bluefish Caves", "answer_start": 1535}]}, {"question": "What did archeologists find in the Bluefish Caves?", "id": "1999-W19-1-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a mammoth bone that was probably flaked and shaped by human hands roughly 23,500 years ago", "answer_start": 1656}, {"text": "a mammoth bone", "answer_start": 1656}]}, {"question": "Who does Jacques Cing-Mars think used the caves?", "id": "1999-W19-1-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "hunters", "answer_start": 2000}]}, {"question": "What does author Heather Pringle think archeology is about?", "id": "1999-W19-1-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "\"uncovering the lives of ancient people\"", "answer_start": 2584}]}]}]}, {"title": "The Phantom Has Opened", "paragraphs": [{"context": "It was just past midnight in Newfoundland and Star Wars was up on the screen.

Advance tickets for the first two days of round-the-clock showings went on sale last week and were quickly snapped up. In cities across Canada fans began lining up for tickets in late April.

Otherwise, they would to have had to wait several months for its Icelandic release. And as if shelling out up to $9 for a Star War's ticket isn't bad enough: How about $50 or more? It's what some scalpers are asking in Los Angeles, California. \"It's horrible,\" said Tom Sherak, who helps distribute the film. \"This is just what we didn't want.\" When tickets went on sale each customer was limited to 12 tickets, although there has been no formal way to stop scalpers from returning to snag more tickets.

For days the air in towns like Iqaluit will be filled with the sounds of banging hammers and ripping cardboard as the goods they ordered from southern Canada finally arrive by ship. Mild temperatures across the eastern Arctic have produced ideal conditions for the 1999 sealift, moving sailing schedules for many communities forward by several weeks. Environment Canada is forecasting early ice break-up as shippers prepare to carry out the annual resupply of building materials, non-perishable food, cars, snowmobiles and boats. During the long winter months food supplies can only arrive by airplane. Food can cost from twice to three times what it does down south. Northerners are used to paying more than two dollars for a can of pop, more than a dollar for an apple and three dollars for a litre of milk. Believe it or not, a simple head of wilted lettuce can cost five dollars. But large, heavy items cannot be transported by airplane. So northern residents order what they need by catalogue or telephone or the Internet, and wait for the ships to arrive in the spring. \"El Nino as you know lasted well into the winter last year, and we've had above normal temperatures the whole winter in the eastern Arctic and Hudson Bay,\" says Rick Power, a spokesman for the Canadian Ice Service. \"So the ice didn't thicken as much as normal in most areas, and it started to clear a little earlier. \"And of course we've had a very mild spring as well.\" Environment Canada's outlook for ice break-up and clearing patterns predicts smooth sailing in much of James Bay, Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait by the first week of July -- a month earlier than normal. Across the Arctic, ice break-up is expected to be three weeks early, on average. Colin Crosbie, vice-president of Nunavut Ocean Transport, and veteran of the northern sealift, described this year's ice conditions as unprecedented. \"I have been involved in shipping in the Arctic since 1969 and certainly nobody I've talked to who had been up there for decades before had ever seen anything like this,\" he says. \"Five years ago, if we had said we were going to Iqaluit June 25 people would say, 'you're crazy.'\" The extended sealift season is a blessing for the booming construction industry in Nunavut, Canada's newest territory. This year, Iqaluit is very scarce on materials, so the fact that it's going to open up early is a positive thing,\" says Suzanne Paquin, vice-president of Nunavut Eastern Arctic Shipping said.", "qas": [{"question": "Why will this year's sealift to northern Canada start early?", "id": "1999-W24-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "early ice break-up", "answer_start": 521}, {"text": "ice break-up is expected to be three weeks early", "answer_start": 1803}]}, {"question": "Why can't all supplies just be flown to northern Canada?", "id": "1999-W24-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "large, heavy items cannot be transported by airplane", "answer_start": 1024}]}, {"question": "How much can a can of pop cost in northern Canada?", "id": "1999-W24-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "more than two dollars", "answer_start": 835}]}, {"question": "What does a litre of milk cost in northern Canada?", "id": "1999-W24-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "three dollars", "answer_start": 911}]}, {"question": "When did Colin Crosbie become involved in shipping in the Arctic?", "id": "1999-W24-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1969", "answer_start": 2069}]}, {"question": "Where is Iqaluit?", "id": "1999-W24-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Baffin Island", "answer_start": 13}, {"text": "northern Canada", "answer_start": 804}]}, {"question": "Who is forecasting smooth sailing in much of James Bay, Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait by the first week of July?", "id": "1999-W24-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Environment Canada", "answer_start": 487}]}]}]}, {"title": "A Step to Curing Diabetes", "paragraphs": [{"context": "A team of Calgary researchers says that they have discovered one of the causes of diabetes. The scientists have spent the last eight years in the lab trying to pinpoint the immune system's role in diabetes. Dr. Ji-Won Yoon and his team at the University of Calgary say their research gives insight into what triggers insulin-dependent diabetes. But, diabetics will have to be patient -- a cure for humans is between five and 10 years away. However, that didn't temper the enthusiasm of diabetic Holly McWilliams. \"This is very exciting,\" said the 18-year-old Calgarian who has had to inject insulin four times a day since she was three years old to stay alive. She now uses an insulin pump to maintain proper levels of the hormone. Diabetics are at risk of blindness, circulatory problems, heart disease and kidney failure, but with proper diet, exercise and insulin, it can be controlled. There are at least two strands of diabetes: Type 1 -- when the body doesn't produce insulin. Type 2 -- when insulin in the body doesn't work properly. Dr. Ji-Won Yoon's discovery affects Type 1 diabetics, which inflicts about 100,000 Canadians. One and a half million Canadians have diabetes; more than 750,000 have it and don't know it. \"This is a major landmark study and it helps us understand the disease in a way we haven't in the past,\" says Dr. David Lau of the Julia McFarlane Diabetes Research Centre. Dr. Yoon's research on mice focuses on how a diabetic's immune system attacks cells that produce insulin, which is needed to help the body properly use sugars. A protein in the pancreas, which produces insulin, plays a critical role in triggering diabetes in mice. Destruction of insulin-producing cells by the immune system can be prevented by halting protein production. Dr. Yoon said his work could lead to transplants of tissue that fight the sugar build-up process or possibly a vaccine. Lau is confident studies on mice will also work on humans.", "qas": [{"question": "How many Canadians have diabetes and don't realize it?", "id": "1999-W20-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "more than 750,00", "answer_start": 1183}]}, {"question": "What kinds of health problems do diabetics potentially face?", "id": "1999-W20-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "blindness, circulatory problems, heart disease and kidney failure", "answer_start": 757}]}, {"question": "How is diabetes currently controlled?", "id": "1999-W20-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "proper diet, exercise and insulin", "answer_start": 833}]}, {"question": "What does insulin do for our bodies?", "id": "1999-W20-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "helps the body properly use sugers", "answer_start": 1531}]}, {"question": "What do Type 1 diabetics' immune systems do to insulin-producing cells?", "id": "1999-W20-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "attacks them", "answer_start": 1471}]}, {"question": "Where does Dr. Yoon's team work?", "id": "1999-W20-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the University of Calgary", "answer_start": 239}, {"text": "Calgary", "answer_start": 10}]}, {"question": "Why will diabetics have to be patient, despite Dr. Ji-Won Yoon's discovery?", "id": "1999-W20-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a cure for humans is between five and 10 years away", "answer_start": 387}]}, {"question": "Who is Holly McWilliams?", "id": "1999-W20-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": " a diabetic", "answer_start": 1444}, {"text": "an 18-year-old Calgarian", "answer_start": 223}, {"text": "an 18-year-old Calgarian who has had to inject insulin four times a day since she was three years old to stay alive", "answer_start": 547}]}]}]}]}
