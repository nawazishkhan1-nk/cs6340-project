{"data": [{"title": "Attacking Measles", "paragraphs": [{"context": "One of the most miserable parts of childhood is about to disappear from the hemisphere. Measles is on track to being eliminated throughout North and South America by the turn of the millennium. At least that's the opinion of a number of health experts. Last year Canada had only 12 cases of measles, down from about 2,500 in 1995. \"It has been a surprise to me that measles has disappeared as quickly as it did,\" says Donald Henderson of the Pan American Health Organization. Most children who get measles will have a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, and watery eyes. These symptoms last for 1 or 2 weeks. But measles also causes ear infections in nearly 1 out of every 10 children who get it. As many as 1 out of 20 children with measles gets pneumonia. And about 1 child in every 1,000 who get measles will get encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain that can lead to convulsions, and can leave the child deaf or mentally disabled. For every 1,000 children who get measles, 1 or 2 will die from it. Measles can also make a pregnant woman have a miscarriage or give birth prematurely. Anti-measles immunization began in Canada in 1957. Before that virtually every child went through a bout with the disease. But the single-dose vaccine was not fully effective. In August 1995 an advisory committee recommended that all children be given a second dose of vaccine. The new policy was adopted in all provinces and territories. Rubella, commonly referred to as German measles, is a different disease with similar symptoms. It remains a problem and is one of the next targets for elimination. Measles is the latest in a string of successes for childhood vaccination programs, but experts fear they could be undermined by growing public suspicion about the risks and side-effects of immunization. Last year a group of Manitoba parents went to court in an effort to block a program to immunize Grade Four students against Hepatitis B. They lost their court case, but many parents chose not to have their children vaccinated, says Robert Pless of the federal Laboratory Centre for Disease Control.", "qas": [{"question": "How many cases of measles were there in 1995 in Canada?", "id": "1999-W16-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "2,500", "answer_start": 316}]}, {"question": "When did Canadian children begin to receive anti-measles vaccinations?", "id": "1999-W16-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1957", "answer_start": 1138}]}, {"question": "What is Rubella?", "id": "1999-W16-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "German measles", "answer_start": 1465}, {"text": "a different disease with similar symptoms", "answer_start": 1484}]}, {"question": "Why do some parents not get their children vaccinated?", "id": "1999-W16-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "growing public suspicion about the risks and side-effects of immunization", "answer_start": 1724}]}, {"question": "Who tried to prevent Grade Four Students from being immunized against Hepatitis B?", "id": "1999-W16-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a group of Manitoba parents", "answer_start": 1809}]}, {"question": "Where does Donald Henderson work?", "id": "1999-W16-3-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Pan American Health Organization", "answer_start": 442}]}]}]}, {"title": "Evacuation in Northern Saskatchewan", "paragraphs": [{"context": "More than half the residents of the northern Saskatchewan community of La Ronge were evacuated briefly yesterday as a forest fire scorched its outskirts. But roughly 1,500 residents were able to return to their homes last night as winds died and the danger decreased. A number of homes and businesses on the town's northern edge were destroyed. And the evacuees remained on alert, ready to run again on a moment's notice if hot spots flared up. La Ronge is a community of 2,800 people located 300 kilometres north of Saskatoon. It is located on lac La Ronge. Residents \"have to go back with the understanding that they could be called out at any moment,\" says RCMP Cpl. Gary MacDonald. Although the evacuees were told they could spend the night in the local arena, virtually all the townspeople chose to sleep in their own beds. Volunteer firefighters were to remain on patrol all night, ready to run door-to-door and give the alert if winds picked up and sparked a new blaze. Trees were still burning at Gary Vettree's in Eagle Point, which was directly in the path of a fast-moving fire. His was one of two homes still standing; seven houses just down the road burned to the ground. Vettree saved his house by soaking it with water. \"Scary, really scary,\" he says of the blaze, \"Smoke, fire, animals running all over, rabbits, birds.\" After days of dry winds and electrical storms - there have been 3,000 lightning strikes over the last couple days - the fire began in the bush southwest of town at about noon Thursday. Strong winds pushed it northeast and by 1 p.m., when the fire grew dangerously close to a bulk fuel station, RCMP were running from door to door asking people to leave. \"People were crying,\" says one resident, who loaded up his photo albums and hooked his prized boat to his car before leaving his home with his wife. \"At that point the fire was about a quarter-mile away.\" The fire shot six metres above the trees as it roared through the industrial area of town. Highway 2 was closed. \"I watched the fire, when it was just feet away from an industrial shop, burn the end of the building,\" said the man, who didn't want his name used. Evacuees were housed in the local health clinic and a hockey arena. \"In some places it was so bad you could hardly see,\" says restaurant worker Angela Krienke. Some evacuees with respiratory problems received treatment. There are 459 firefighters fighting the fires in Northern Saskatchewan. Working or on standby for fire suppression activities are: 24 helicopters, 12 water bomber aircraft, 8 bulldozers and 1 swamp tractor. Early damage estimates include a shop burned out in the industrial area. Several mobile homes were destroyed, as were four large buildings and four cabins at a local lakeside resort. No injuries were reported. \"It's amazing that so much vegetation on the perimeter of our community was totally destroyed and we were very fortunate that so little property was destroyed,\" says La Ronge Mayor Joe Hordyski. \"It's just a miracle.\" In northern Alberta, meanwhile, a forest fire just north of Fort McMurray threatened the region's power supply as it burned out of control Thursday. There are a number of fires burning near Fort McMurray, three out of control. None were threatening the town. Lower winds and less smoke removed the need to evacuate the small aboriginal community of Janvier, about 120 kilometres southeast of Fort McMurray.", "qas": [{"question": "How many people live in La Ronge?", "id": "1999-W22-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "2,800", "answer_start": 472}]}, {"question": "Who is the mayor of La Ronge?", "id": "1999-W22-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Joe Hordyski", "answer_start": 2976}]}, {"question": "Why did Gary Vettree's house not burn down?", "id": "1999-W22-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "he soaked it with water", "answer_start": 1220}]}, {"question": "How high was the fire in the industrial area of town?", "id": "1999-W22-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "six metres above the trees", "answer_start": 1910}]}, {"question": "Where were the evacuees taken when the fire threatened their homes?", "id": "1999-W22-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the local health clinic and a hockey arena", "answer_start": 2182}]}, {"question": "When were the evacuees able to go back to their homes?", "id": "1999-W22-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "last night", "answer_start": 217}, {"text": "the night of May 27, 1999", "answer_start": 735}]}]}]}, {"title": "Ringing in the Landmine Ban", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Church bells around the world rang out at noon yesterday as an international ban on landmines became international law. Canada was one of the leading countries behind the ban. In Melbourne, Australia bells rang at Saint Michael's Uniting Church. In Brasilia, the capital city of Brazil, anti-landmine pamphlets were distributed and there were screenings of \"Spotlight on a Massacre\", an anti-landmines film in Portuguese. In Paris, France members of carillon associations - people who are experts at ringing bells - coordinated the ringing of cathedral bells across the city. And there was bell-ringing in approximately 30 Buddhist temples and Christian churches in 10 cities throughout Japan, including Hiroshima, Tokyo and Osaka. The pact was agreed to by 130 countries in Ottawa, Ontario in 1997. Russia, the United States, China and Ukraine did not sign the treaty. Despite these notable absences, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jody Williams, of The International Campaign to Ban Landmines, says the accord has an impact for many other countries in the world. The head of the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan described the treaty's entry into force as a milestone. \"It is a day whose arrival few could have predicted, and whose import to the millions whose lives or limbs may be saved from these barbarous weapons cannot be overestimated,\" Mr. Annan said. Pope John Paul added his voice to the effort, urging more countries to sign the treaty. The treaty prohibits the use, production and storage of anti-personnel landmines and sets a time limit for destroying stocks and clearing mine fields. There are two categories of landmines: antipersonnel (AP) and antitank or anti-vehicle (AT): -Anti-personnel (AP) landmine - \"A mine designed to be exploded by the presence, proximity or contact of a person and that will incapacitate, injure or kill one or more persons.\" -Anti-tank (AT) landmine - An AT mine is a device designed to detonate by more than 100 kilograms of pressure. AT mines cannot distinguish between a tank and tractor The United States has refused to sign the treaty, saying it needs the mines for its defence along the border between North and South Korea. The governments of North and South Korea have been in constant conflict for more then 40 years. Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy spearheaded the political initiative to get the treaty ratified. \"For us, this is a very important day,\" Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said. He said the treaty is a stepping stone to furthering what he calls the human security agenda.

The Red Cross is thanking the public for donating more than $250,000 to help refugees in the Balkans over the past two months. Spokesperson Adrienne Bakker says the Red Cross Appeal has received an average of $20,000 a week. But B.C.'s attorney general says few people have come forward to help the Kosovo refugees who will soon arrive in British Columbia. Ujal Dosnajh stresses there is no cost, and no requirement to put refugees in homes. Mr. Dosanjh says he is looking for more than 200 sponsors who can provide emotional and psychological support. Church groups, schools, and businesses can offer their assistance to the government. \"Kosovars\" is the term generally used for people of Albanian ethnic heritage who live in the southern Yugolsavian province of Kosovo. In Calgary, Alberta, for example, the Unitarian Church is sponsoring a group of refugees. This means everything from finding clothes and shelter to finding schools for the children and jobs for their parents. One member of the church, Thordis Gutnick, will be spending the next couple of months teaching English to the refugees. She is looking forward to it as she says it will allow her to show them what a wonderful country Canada can be. She is also looking forward to discussing the NATO bombing with them. Ms. Gutnick has been opposed to the bombing since it began on March 24. She wants to hear the opinions of the refugees and try and better understand what is happening in Yugoslavia. So far nearly 5,000 Kosovo refugees have come to Canada. But they won't be the last displaced Kosovars headed here. More refugees will continue to arrive under Canada's family reunification plan. \"Some 2,000 people have been identified as potentially eligible for that program. Of those, 400 have already arrived,\" says Raphael Girard, Canada's ambassador to Yugoslavia. Canada has set no limit for the number of refugees eligible for the family reunification plan. When the airlift ends Wednesday, Canada will have fulfilled its pledge to accept 5,000 refugees. Officials say Ottawa won't take in more unless requested by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Out of 135,000 spaces for refugees offered by the international community, only 55,000 have been transported out of the region in the last month. The ambassador said that there is anxiety among the Kosovar leadership that by taking refugees so far afield \"many of these people will not return and in so doing Yugoslavia President Slobodan Milosevic's agenda (of getting rid of ethnic Albanians living in the southern Yugoslavian province of Kosovo) will be achieved.\" In total, 1.6 million people have fled Kosovo as Yugoslavian Serb forces purge the province of ethnic Albanians.

Armine Yalnizyan, an economist who studied the differences between Canada's rich and poor,  found that the difference between rich and poor was growing fastest in Alberta. Yalnizyan also noted that Albertans are extremely competitive, and have a \" law of the jungle\" view of life. It's this outlook of, `If you can get it, keep it. And if you're not getting it, then you're a loser,''' Ms. Yalnizyan said Thursday during a speech. Yalnizyan added that she did not hear that type of thinking in too many places in Canada. Yalnizyan's report is for the Centre For Social Justice in Toronto. It uses Statistics Canada figures to look at growing income differences between Canada's rich and poor. When Yalnizyan looked at the Alberta data, she discovered that while Alberta's economy is growing, the difference between the rich and poor is expanding more rapidly than anywhere else in Canada. The difference is most noticeable in Calgary where the city's prosperity has meant more high-paying management jobs, but also more unstable and low-paying part-time work. Yalnizyan feels that attitudes are as much to blame for this inequality as government spending cuts, a low minimum wage and the spread of part-time jobs. She argues that cultural expectations are one of the first factors shaping the way the labour market performs. One example, she said, is Albertans' enthusiasm for tax cuts even though the province's health care and education systems are in bad shape, and need tax money to be improved. \"There's a kind of sky's-the-limit attitude. What's mine is mine.

For this cruel land can cast a spell which no temperate clime can match.\" - T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) While adventurer Jamie Clarke was crossing the world s harshest desert, he often thought his 1997 trip up Mount Everest had been easier. \"I ll never cross the Rub al-Khaly again,\" said the adventurer from Calgary, Alberta of his 39-day trek across the Arabian desert. \"But I d climb Everest.\" Clarke spoke from the comfort of a hotel room in Abu Dhabi and recalled the desert s challenges: threatening quicksand, mountainous sand dunes and blazing heat. Halfway through the journey, Clarke thought his chances of completing the trek were slim. But he and his team fought frustration, thirst, sandstorms and a scorching sun to make the 1,200-km journey that took them from Oman, through Saudi Arabia and into the United Arab Emirates. Not only did the six-man, 12-camel team make it, they beat their own deadline by three days. \"We are tired, thirsty and hungry, but ecstatic to be here,\" Clarke said. Clarke and two other Calgary residents, his brother Leigh and friend Bruce Kirkby, set out Feb. 2 from Salalah, Oman, along with three Bedouin guides and their camels. On March 12, they reached Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. They became the first Westerners in more than fifty years to cross the severe Arabian desert. \"The first thing I did when I came to the hotel was open the tap and pour a glass of cold water,\" Clarke said. \"In the desert, you had to be really thirsty to drink water stored in goat skin.\" He described the stored water, which became contaminated with goat hair and fat, as tasting like \"watered chocolate milk.\" He marvels at how lucky we are to be able to drink from a tap. There are no permanent roads or settlements in the desert, which covers 300,000 square kilometres of southern Arabia. It has been a lure to adventurers since British traveller Wilfred Thesiger crossed it in 1947 and wrote about his journey. Daytime temperatures reached 49 degrees Celsius, with the sand even hotter: 80 degrees Celsius. At night, the temperature fell as low as nine degrees. \"Before the journey, for months, all I thought about was being in the desert. I dreamt about it,\" Clarke said. \"When I got there, I couldn t wait to finish.\" Clarke said his relationship with the camels left an lasting mark on him. \"The camel became part of me. I became part of the camel. Listening to it, feeling it, becomes an extension of you because your life depends on it.\" He added that \"you have to be nice to it, you have to talk softly and show your love\" or you ll be trying to work with a grumpy, screaming beast. The trek left the men with blistered skin, chapped lips and less weight. Each lost at least 11 pounds. Clarke and his team sent reports and photos about their trip by satellite phone to a Web site that drew more than three million visitors. \"The kids were a great motivation, I felt they were cheering us on. \"I wouldn't advise someone to go there for 40 days.

The virus is called \"Melissa.\" Melissa, identified by symbols that form a winking smiley face, usually contains the subject line, \"Important message,\" and the body says \"Here is that document you asked for ... don't show it to anyone else.\" The virus launches documents into cyberspace and can clog e-mail servers, security experts said yesterday. Users may think they are receiving e-mail from a friend because the virus takes real addresses out of a users own address books. Over the weekend, businesses and governments around the world were contacting experts to see if Melissa can be stopped. One team of virus experts is at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The university has a \"Computer Emergency Response Team.\"  Katherine Fithen is with the team. She says the Melissa e-mail should be considered a potential security breach. \"It's safe to say we're bracing ourselves,\" she says. The Melissa virus spreads via Microsoft's widely used Word 97 and Word 2000 documents, which can be attached to e-mail messages, as well as Microsoft's Outlook and Outlook Express e-mail program. If a computer user opens the infected Word document, the virus propagates itself by reading the user's e-mail address book and sends an infected message to the first 50 entries. People cannot get the virus by merely opening up a message, only by opening the attached document. REMEMBER, NEVER OPEN A DOCUMENT ATTACHMENT FROM SOMEONE YOU DON'T KNOW. And now in this case, you can't even trust all the documents you receive from people you do know! Use common sense, and always be careful of anything that you receive via e-mail. Carnegie-Mellon's experts first learned of the virus Friday afternoon and its members worked through the night to analyze it. But the full reach of the virus may only become clear today when millions sit down at their computer terminals.

Camille Laurin was 76. He had been ill with cancer. Dr. Laurin was a psychiatrist who became active in Quebec politics during the 1960's. He was first elected to the Quebec National Assembly, Quebec's legislative assembly,  in 1970. Dr. Camille Laurin once described his beloved language law as the \"re-conquest\" of Quebec. He was referring to the history of Quebec. During the 18th and 19th century, French-speaking Quebecers were often ruled by governments that were controlled by England. Many French-speaking Quebecers considered themselves to have been conquered by \"les anglais\" - the English. By the 1950's French-speaking Quebecers were increasingly convinced that the only way to stand up for their own rights was for Quebec to become an independent country, separate from Canada. Camille Laurin was among them. Bill 101 required signs in Quebec to be in French. Before Bill 101 became law many signs in Quebec were only in English, even though the majority of the population is French speaking. Bill 101 also required the children of immigrants to go to French schools. Many French-speaking Quebecers were worried that immigrants would choose English schools for their children. That would mean that the French language would slowly die away. Many English-speaking Quebecers did not like Bill 101 because they felt it took away their freedom to put up English signs. They also disagreed with the government telling immigrants which schools they must attend. Bill 101 came into effect in 1977. For many years it was big news in Quebec as there were many demonstrations - both from people who supported the bill and from those who hated it. One thing was never in question, however, was Dr. Laurin's passionate love of Quebec. \"Dr. Laurin was a pioneer, a builder, a man of conviction, determined,\" says Francois Gendron, chairman of the Parti Quebecois caucus in the legislature. Liberal opposition Leader Jean Charest praised his protection of the French language. \"He was a man who was devoted to the interests of Quebec  and in that sense today is a day of sadness for us.\" To some in the English-language community, Laurin symbolized francophones who wanted to crush the anglophone minority. William Johnson, a hardline English-rights activist, said he was personally saddened by the death of his ideological opponent. \"He was very cultivated man, with a seductive charm.\" But the president of the Alliance Quebec English-rights lobby condemned Laurin's masterwork as an attempt to \"wipe out bilingualism\" in Canada. Bill 101 is credited by Quebec nationalists as helping preserve the French language in a sea of English in North America. Dr. Laurin made no apologies for the law's toughness, saying the law simply reflected Quebec's demographic reality. Although it meant a lower profile for anglophones and less clout after years of predominance, Laurin said it took away no basic rights and recognized their institutions, schools and media.", "qas": [{"question": "What is Bill 101?", "id": "1999-W11-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Quebec's very controversial language law", "answer_start": 72}]}, {"question": "What does Bill 101 require?", "id": "1999-W11-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "signs in Quebec to be in French", "answer_start": 956}, {"text": "immigrant children to attend French schools", "answer_start": 1161}]}, {"question": "Who described Dr. Laurin as \"a pioneer, a builder, a man of conviction, determined\"?", "id": "1999-W11-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Francois Gendron, chairman of the Parti Quebecois caucus in the legislature", "answer_start": 1929}, {"text": "Francois Gendron", "answer_start": 1929}]}, {"question": "When did Bill 101 come into effect?", "id": "1999-W11-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1977", "answer_start": 1614}]}, {"question": "How does the president of the Alliance Quebec English-rights lobby describe Laurin's masterwork, Bill 101?", "id": "1999-W11-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "as an attempt to \"wipe out bilingualism\" in Canada", "answer_start": 2595}]}, {"question": "How do Quebec nationalists credit Bill 101?", "id": "1999-W11-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "as helping preserve the French language", "answer_start": 2691}, {"text": "as helping to preserve the French language in a sea of English in North America", "answer_start": 2702}]}]}]}, {"title": "Refugees Arrive in Nova Scotia", "paragraphs": [{"context": "A second planeload of refugees from Kosovo landed in Canada early this morning. The 264 people are among the first of the 5,000 people of Albanian heritage from the southern Yugoslavian province of Kosovo who will be coming to Canada. The refugees have been living in tents in the Stenkovac refugee camp in Macedonia since they left Yugoslavia. The plane touched down at Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Greenwood, Nova Scotia, at 1 a.m. local time, 10 hours behind schedule. The tired Albanians put on smiles for Red Cross volunteers and military officials. They told waiting reporters they were grateful for the safety Canada provides, but it was clear many will spend their time in Canada dreaming of returning home. On hand to greet his countrymen was Burnaby, British Columbia resident Shamsay Amoosa. Mr. Amoosa fled his homeland six years ago - from a civil war that few outside the country then paid attention to. \"Canada is a good country,\" Amoosa told the refugees. \"You will be safe here until things are better at home and then we will help you go back if you want.\" Ahmet Konyoury, who was on the plane with his wife and youngest daughter, said he didn't want to leave Kosovo. Rather, he had no choice. \"People over there, like Serbian military, said 'You like NATO, go there,' 'You like Clinton, go there,'\" he told CBC News through a translator. The Konyourys were one of the lucky ones who made it to Canada. At the filthy and overcrowded camps on Wednesday, thousands of refugees waited anxiously to hear their names called for overbooked flights to Canada. Officials had overbooked the plane after some families changed their mind at the last minute and didn't show up for the first flight. But on Wednesday, almost all the families lined up for the flight -- plus some. That meant delays as officials tried to sort out who would go and who must stay. Like the Konyourys -- and the refugees who wait still -- each person, each family, has a story about their plight, and their hopes for the future. The United Nations says the Kosovo refugee crisis could grow by another half million. Here are the numbers so far: 17,000 refugees in Bosnia, 62,000 in Montenegro, 404,000 in Albania, and 211,000 in Macedonia. There seems to be some movement towards putting an end to the war in Yugoslavia. The world's major powers may be close to a diplomatic breakthrough to end the conflict. The Group of Eight nations, including Russia, the United States, and Canada, have agreed to a seven-point plan to find peace in Kosovo, including the basic terms of an international force to secure the return of refugees. The plan must now be approved by the United Nations Security Council, which represents 185 countries from all over the world. The Yugoslavian government has not yet reacted to the plan.", "qas": [{"question": "Where in Nova Scotia did the plane carrying Kosovo refugees land?", "id": "1999-W19-4-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Greenwood", "answer_start": 371}, {"text": "Greenwood", "answer_start": 398}, {"text": "Canadian Forces Base Greenwood", "answer_start": 371}, {"text": "Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Greenwood, Nova Scotia", "answer_start": 371}, {"text": "Greenwood, Nova Scotia", "answer_start": 398}]}, {"question": "How will many of the Kosovo refugees spend their time in Canada?", "id": "1999-W19-4-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "dreaming of returning home", "answer_start": 686}]}, {"question": "When did Shamsay Amoosa flee his homeland of Kosovo?", "id": "1999-W19-4-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "six years ago", "answer_start": 830}]}, {"question": "Who was with Ahmet Konyoury on the plane to Canada?", "id": "1999-W19-4-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "his wife and youngest daughter", "answer_start": 1115}]}, {"question": "How many countries worldwide does the United Nations Security Council represent?", "id": "1999-W19-4-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "185", "answer_start": 2699}]}]}]}, {"title": "UN says Canada number one", "paragraphs": [{"context": "For the sixth year in a row, the United Nations has ranked Canada as the best country in the world to live in.

That is better than many countries, but below top countries like Norway and Japan. Not all of the UN report was good news. Canada ranked ninth in the world when it came to dealing with poverty.
