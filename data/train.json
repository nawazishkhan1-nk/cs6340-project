The Alberta Teachers Association says it's frustrating to see the provincial government more preoccupied with tax cuts than education. Local union president Kurt Moench says funding needs to be provided for teacher salaries and student growth. Class size is the biggest stumbling block in the dispute between the board and the teachers' union. The teachers say that there are too many students in each class and that means students are not getting all of the help they need. The 6,600 teachers want the return of a ratio of one teacher for every 18.4 students. Alberta Premier Ralph Klein said even he expects teachers to walk off the job. \"I think there's going to be a strike -- I hope that there won't be,\" said Klein in Edmonton, the province's capitol city. The province's education minister has urged both sides to keep talking.

Rasmussen's disease is a very rare form of brain disease that can occur at any time in childhood. It affects only about 1,000 people around the world. It is not known what causes the disease, but it is known that cells in one half of the brain become inflamed, or puffy when infected. As a result, the affected brain cells malfunction, and fire off electrical energy when they are not supposed to. This energy causes epileptic seizures. Seizures cause a violent jerking of the arms and legs, and are difficult to control with medication. Amber had the left side of her brain removed. The left side of the brain controls speech and some body movements, so the surgery could leave Amber without the ability to talk. But if she had not had the surgery, she could have had difficulty moving, learning, and maybe even died. The surgery performed on Amber is called a hemispherectomy, and is usually performed on younger patients. Amber's surgeon says she is in fair condition following her nine-hour surgery.

In Paris, France members of carillon associations - people who are experts at ringing bells - coordinated the ringing of cathedral bells across the city. And there was bell-ringing in approximately 30 Buddhist temples and Christian churches in 10 cities throughout Japan, including Hiroshima, Tokyo and Osaka.

Despite these notable absences, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jody Williams, of The International Campaign to Ban Landmines, says the accord has an impact for many other countries in the world. The head of the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan described the treaty's entry into force as a milestone. \"It is a day whose arrival few could have predicted, and whose import to the millions whose lives or limbs may be saved from these barbarous weapons cannot be overestimated,\" Mr. Annan said. Pope John Paul added his voice to the effort, urging more countries to sign the treaty. The treaty prohibits the use, production and storage of anti-personnel landmines and sets a time limit for destroying stocks and clearing mine fields. There are two categories of landmines: antipersonnel (AP) and antitank or anti-vehicle (AT): -Anti-personnel (AP) landmine - \"A mine designed to be exploded by the presence, proximity or contact of a person and that will incapacitate, injure or kill one or more persons.\" -Anti-tank (AT) landmine - An AT mine is a device designed to detonate by more than 100 kilograms of pressure. AT mines cannot distinguish between a tank and tractor The United States has refused to sign the treaty, saying it needs the mines for its defence along the border between North and South Korea. The governments of North and South Korea have been in constant conflict for more then 40 years. Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy spearheaded the political initiative to get the treaty ratified. \"For us, this is a very important day,\" Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said. He said the treaty is a stepping stone to furthering what he calls the human security agenda. The challenge now, he said, is to make the pact work."}]}, {"title": "Winter's Going...

More than 76 centimetres of snow has fallen in Saint John's since the blizzard started yesterday afternoon. A couple of thousand kilometres west, it is a whole different story.

They were wrong. Calgary didn't get a single snowflake in March so on Sunday, the crew filming the movie, which stars Chevy Chase, unloaded 450 dump truck loads of snow. They transformed a Calgary street into a wintry scene set in Syracuse, New York. They laid white tarps and carefully placed hay bales to boost the snow height, then added the transplanted snow. Set workers then methodically shoveled so it would look just right. The street was complete with snowed-in cars, phony icicles dangling from the eaves of neighbourhood homes and bits of white felt on some of the roofs. Sunday's snow was hauled from Canada Olympic Park in the city's west end, where the movie's creators had been making it artificially. Ironically, the crew had previously been filming in Edmonton, where there was lots of snow.

The former British colony formally joined confederation on March 31, 1949 -- 82 years after Canada became a country. Some Newfoundlanders marked the occasion by re-creating the vote that brought the province into Canada. The town of Saint Anthony staged a referendum during the last 10 days but with a different result than that of half a century ago. This time the \"No\" side won by a slim margin. Of the 934 people who cast ballots, 53 per cent opposed joining Canada. In fact, the referendum also mirrors history. The first time Newfoundlanders voted in 1948 they rejected union with Canada. It was only in the second vote that Newfoundlanders said \"yes\". It's a result many Newfoundlanders and their politicians have wondered about over the years. Where would Newfoundland be today if the referendum results had been reversed and 52 per cent of voters chose independence? Newfoundlander John Crosbie was a minister in the Conservative government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.  He thinks the province may have been all right on its own. \"It is highly likely we would have survived,\" Crosbie said. \"It would have been a lot more work and more difficult, but it wouldn't have been necessarily a disaster had we continued as an independent dominion.\" But Mr. Crosbie does recognize the benefits of the union. \"Our quality of life is better here today because people have a basic level of security,\" he says. Mr. Crosbie says a number of federal government programs like unemployment insurance and aid packages to fishers who are out of work are just a few of the reasons Newfoundlanders should count their blessings. Newfoundland was granted full British colonial status in the early 19th century. The Royal Navy began escorting ships to the Grand Banks fishing grounds for the summer fishing season and soon developed seasonal communities along the coast. As permanent settlements formed, civil governors replaced fishing admirals and colonial political institutions were set up. Newfoundland s first popularly elected legislative assembly convened in Saint John s in 1832. In the decades that followed, the colony was run by representative government, and later, responsible government in 1855. The population was also strongly divided by religion -- half were Protestant, half Roman Catholic. By the turn of the century, Newfoundland was a self-governing colony that played a small role in international affairs. But life in small communities dotting the coast -- called outports -- was rough. Poverty, starvation and disease were rampant. By the end of the Second World War, union with Canada was once again being mentioned. Newfoundlanders were swept up in a passionate debate between a pro-union movement called the Confederates and an anti-union movement that wanted Newfoundland to have what was called \"responsible government\", that is, to remain independent from Canada. A vote was held on July 22, 1948. On the morning of July 23, 1948, Newfoundlanders awoke to hear that the Confederates had won.

The 13-year-old from Martensville, Saskatchewan died last Wednesday at a hospital in Saskatoon. Tyrell had a cancerous tumour in his leg. He and his parents refused traditional treatments, such as chemotherapy (radiation treatment) and amputation. Instead they decided to use herbal, and alternative treatments that included large doses of vitamins and a special diet. The Saskatchewan government didn't think alternative medicine would work, and felt Tyrell's parents were pressuring him to refuse traditional medicine. The province went to court to force him to undergo surgery for the cancer in his leg. Tyrell waited three months for treatment as his case went through the courts. When it was discovered the cancer had spread to Tyrell's lungs, the province dropped the case. Shortly after, Tyrell's parents took the boy to Mexico for the alternative treatment. Doctors in Mexico said he was cancer-free. They said that Canadian doctors got the diagnosis wrong. Tyrell returned from Mexico in April. His condition got worse. Tyrell's tumour started bleeding and he needed blood transfusions. He was admitted to hospital and died Wednesday night. Joe Bourgeault, a supporter of alternative medicine, helped raise money to pay for Tyrell's treatment in Mexico. He says in Tyrell's case, government interference meant alternative treatment may have been delayed too long. \"Tyrell believed alternative cancer therapy was going to improve his chances of survival. Had he been given that option, instead of being withheld from it for three months, he could very well be fully recovered today.\" The funeral was held in Gruenthal, north of Saskatoon."}]}, {"title": "America Mourns JFK Jr", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where did John Jr's plane crash?", "id": "1999-W30-1-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the water off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts", "answer_start": 193}]}, {"question": "What does it mean when a \"search and rescue\" mission becomes a \"search and recovery\" mission?", "id": "1999-W30-1-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "there is little hope of finding any survivors", "answer_start": 619}]}, {"question": "Why does the U.S. Coast Guard want to find the plane's crash site?", "id": "1999-W30-1-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "to find some clues as to how the crash happened", "answer_start": 730}]}, {"question": "Who was John F.

They believe the Canadian wrestler's costume had something to do with the tragedy. The accident happened Sunday at a World Wrestling Federation event. Owen Hart was being lowered into the ring from the rafters of the arena. Police say Mr. Hart's cape may have been tangled with the release cord on his harness, causing it to release too early. Mr. Hart fell 18 metres into the ring. Mr. Hart's brother Ron blames the accident on the Wrestling Federation's constant search for more spectacular stunts and the desire to attract more television viewers. The WWF says the stunt will never be performed again. It seems it takes more than a full nelson or a vicious body slam to impress the rabid pro wrestling fans of the '90s. \"Frankly, wrestling was getting so far out and my poor brother Owen was a sacrifice for the television ratings,\" says Owen's sister Ellie Hart. Yesterday brother Bret \"Hitman\" Hart, also a wrestler, told an American televison network that Owen was uneasy about the stunt, \"but somehow over the weekend he got talked into doing it again.\" \"We're professional wrestlers,\" Bret Hart said. \"We take our falls on the mat, inside the ring. \"I was never a stuntman, and my brother Owen was never a stuntman.\" Keith Pelley, who is vice-president of programming for the Canadian television network TSN (which carries wrestling), says the WWF's ratings are among his network's highest. TSN carries the WWF's Raw is War show every week. \"The WWF and curling are probably our two highest-rated shows. You would be surprised by how many closet wrestling fans there are. The average viewer is 18 to 49, with the 34 to 49 age group being very dominant.\" Wrestling is now so mainstream that a former star Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura was elected governor of the American state of Minnesota, and Hulk Hogan is considering running for president of the United States. But that has not stopped many people from questioning the violent nature of the sport and wondering if more restrictions should not be put on when it is aired. Wrestling is one of the world's oldest sports. There are dozens of varieties practiced all over the world, from Sumo wrestling in Japan to Greco-Roman wrestling practiced in Europe. Professional wrestling has nothing to do with amateur wrestling.

The goal is to show some wayward Inuit the traditional ways. On a typical day in this northern community, a hunting party is about to head out. This one includes two prisoners from the Baffin Correctional Centre (BCC), both convicted of assault, both trying to reconnect with Inuit traditions and culture. Moshe Akavak, a guard with the BCC says learning the traditional ways will help the prisoners' rehabilitation. \"If they go out, they keep themselves busy doing hunting, repairing equipment, it's good for them.\" The party is hunting caribou, far from the city on the frozen tundra. Michael Evic is serving a two-year sentence for assault and other crimes. Out on the tundra with the hunting party he aims at his prey with a high powered rifle. His first shot misses. He tries again. This time he's successful. Inuit believe it takes more than killing an animal to become a hunter. What happens afterwards is just as important. Part of the instruction is learning how to carefully skin and carve a caribou the way Inuit have always done it. When Moshe Akavak became a jail guard 16 years ago, he was appalled so many Inuit had lost their traditional skills. He believes that's why some became criminals. \"Anything they learn from the land program, or from other people, of course, they will be willing to pass on to their children.\" He says over the years hundreds of prisoners have been given guns and knives and taught how to use them. There's never been a problem. \"The more you trust other people, you also gain it back.\" This is just one of the traditional hunting programs for prisoners. In the summer they go after seals. Depending on how well they do they could be sent to an outpost camp where they'll hunt and fish for months at a time. It's all very expensive, costing tens of thousands of dollars for equipment, clothing and supervision. But many believe it's money well spent. \"Whenever you have inmates that come out of jail feeling good about themselves and wanting to succeed I think that cost is well borne out in terms of perhaps reduced recidivism [a return to committing crimes].  And I think you have the chance for these people to return to their communities and contribute,\" says John McKnight, warden of the centre. The prisoners, like Michael Evic, believe learning traditional hunting skills will straighten out their lives. \"I'll just keep on working and go hunting on weekends and keep out of booze or drugs, that was my problem,\" Evic says."}]}, {"title": "Canadians Triumph Over Harsh Desert", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who said Bedouin ways are \"a death in life.\"?", "id": "1999-W12-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "T.E.

For this cruel land can cast a spell which no temperate clime can match.\" - T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) While adventurer Jamie Clarke was crossing the world s harshest desert, he often thought his 1997 trip up Mount Everest had been easier. \"I ll never cross the Rub al-Khaly again,\" said the adventurer from Calgary, Alberta of his 39-day trek across the Arabian desert. \"But I d climb Everest.\" Clarke spoke from the comfort of a hotel room in Abu Dhabi and recalled the desert s challenges: threatening quicksand, mountainous sand dunes and blazing heat. Halfway through the journey, Clarke thought his chances of completing the trek were slim. But he and his team fought frustration, thirst, sandstorms and a scorching sun to make the 1,200-km journey that took them from Oman, through Saudi Arabia and into the United Arab Emirates. Not only did the six-man, 12-camel team make it, they beat their own deadline by three days. \"We are tired, thirsty and hungry, but ecstatic to be here,\" Clarke said. Clarke and two other Calgary residents, his brother Leigh and friend Bruce Kirkby, set out Feb. 2 from Salalah, Oman, along with three Bedouin guides and their camels. On March 12, they reached Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. They became the first Westerners in more than fifty years to cross the severe Arabian desert. \"The first thing I did when I came to the hotel was open the tap and pour a glass of cold water,\" Clarke said. \"In the desert, you had to be really thirsty to drink water stored in goat skin.\" He described the stored water, which became contaminated with goat hair and fat, as tasting like \"watered chocolate milk.\" He marvels at how lucky we are to be able to drink from a tap. There are no permanent roads or settlements in the desert, which covers 300,000 square kilometres of southern Arabia. It has been a lure to adventurers since British traveller Wilfred Thesiger crossed it in 1947 and wrote about his journey. Daytime temperatures reached 49 degrees Celsius, with the sand even hotter: 80 degrees Celsius. At night, the temperature fell as low as nine degrees. \"Before the journey, for months, all I thought about was being in the desert. I dreamt about it,\" Clarke said. \"When I got there, I couldn t wait to finish.\" Clarke said his relationship with the camels left an lasting mark on him. \"The camel became part of me. I became part of the camel. Listening to it, feeling it, becomes an extension of you because your life depends on it.\" He added that \"you have to be nice to it, you have to talk softly and show your love\" or you ll be trying to work with a grumpy, screaming beast. The trek left the men with blistered skin, chapped lips and less weight. Each lost at least 11 pounds. Clarke and his team sent reports and photos about their trip by satellite phone to a Web site that drew more than three million visitors. \"The kids were a great motivation, I felt they were cheering us on. \"I wouldn't advise someone to go there for 40 days. Maybe three, four days tops.\""}]}, {"title": "Who Wrote Sarah's Songs?", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why is producer Daryl Neudorf suing singer Sarah McLachlan?", "id": "1999-W27-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "for song writing credit and a share of money from her first album", "answer_start": 169}]}, {"question": "Where is this case being tried?", "id": "1999-W27-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Vancouver, British Columbia", "answer_start": 105}]}, {"question": "What does Neudorf claim about the eight songs on Sarah McLachlan's first album?", "id": "1999-W27-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "he co-wrote four of those songs ", "answer_start": 613}]}, {"question": "How is Neudorf given credit on the album cover?", "id": "1999-W27-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "for pre-production, coordination and production assistance", "answer_start": 714}]}, {"question": "Who is Jennifer Conkie?", "id": "1999-W27-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Ms. McLachlan's lawyer", "answer_start": 1023}]}, {"question": "What is Canada's copyright law largely based on?", "id": "1999-W27-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the law in the United Kingdom", "answer_start": 1895}]}, {"question": "Why might it take months before a decision is made in this case?", "id": "1999-W27-3-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "because of the complexity of the case", "answer_start": 2231}]}, {"question": "When did Canada's copyright act come into effect?", "id": "1999-W27-3-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1924", "answer_start": 1865}]}], "context": "Lawyers for singer Sarah McLachlan and producer Daryl Neudorf were back in front of a judge yesterday in Vancouver, British Columbia. Mr. Neudorf is suing Ms. McLachlan for song writing credit and a share of money from her first album, recorded more than 10 years ago. The case has attracted international attention not only because of Sarah McLachlan's fame, but also because of the legal issues it raises. It is about what is called \"intellectual property\", or who owns ideas. Sarah McLachlan was 20 years old when she recorded the song Sad Clown and seven others on her debut album Touch. Daryl Neudorf claims he co-wrote four of those songs, including Sad Clown. On the album cover Mr. Neudorf is given credit for pre-production, coordination and production assistance. Ms. McLachlan even thanks him for inspiration. But nowhere is he given credit for co-writing. He was paid $3,385.00 for his work. The case all comes down to a question of his word against hers. \"What is the act of authorship,\" says Jennifer Conkie, Ms. McLachlan's lawyer, \"as opposed to all the other kinds of things musicians do in a jam session? That's a debated topic, I think, in the industry and certainly in the law.\" In the busy atmosphere of the recording studio, time is money. Songs are fine-tuned on the spot, and suggestions may come from producers or other musicians. The question is, where does working together end and co-writing begin? \"Usually there is an agreement in writing before they start to do work on a project,\" says Jonathon Simkin, Daryl Neudorf's lawyer. \"And that deals with everything from the royalty paid to how are we going to deal with the possibility that the producer might do some song writing.\" But when Touch was recorded, no such contracts were signed. Now the two are asking the court to sort it all out. Canada's copyright act came into effect in 1924, and is based largely on the law in the United Kingdom.

Shuttle commander Kent Rominger likened the visit to checking in to a \"fantastic hotel,\" with one major exception: \"Right now there's not a space toilet on board, so that makes living here permanently kind of tough.\" Astronaut Tamara Jernigan and Russian crewmate Valery Tokarev led the way inside the unfinished station yesterday evening. \"We are absolutely delighted to be aboard,\" Ms. Jernigan said as she and Mr. Tokarev floated aboard. \"Make yourself at home,\" Mission Control told the seven-member crew. But their welcome quickly gave way to work early today. Inside the Russian-built Zarya control module, Valery Tokarev and Canadian astronaut Julie Payette pulled up the floor and began changing electrical meters on batteries that aren't charging properly. Astronauts Rick Husband and Daniel Barry replaced two electronics boxes for a communication system inside the American Unity chamber, where it was a brisk 14 degrees. The system, which allows ground controllers to transmit and receive commands from the station, had been broken since mid-April but fired up quickly once the repairs were made. \"Your hard work has paid off!\" Mission Control radioed up. \"Well that's super news,\" Mr. Husband replied. Earlier, the crew installed insulation around some fans inside Zarya to reduce the noise level, which Mr. Barry said measured up to 67 decibels. Station officials hoped the mufflers would reduce the noise level to about 60 decibels -- about the same as an office environment. \"It is a little bit noisy in there.\" The National Aeronautics and Space Administration downplayed the multitude of problems coming so soon after the space station's launch. \"In high-tech like this, you're going to have that happen,\" Mission Control's Milt Heflin explains. The astronauts also began hauling supplies from the shuttle into the station.

But the boy refuses to continue the treatment. Today, Judge A. R. Rothery ruled that Tyrell is influenced by his father, and cannot make an independent decision. The judge said the boy is misinformed, and that social services must now step in to help him. Experts testified in court in Saskatoon yesterday that Tyrell is capable of making a decision, but that his decision is based on misinformation from his father. Tyrell s father wants him to undergo alternative therapy at a clinic in Tijuana, Mexico. The treatment consists of herbal remedies, doses of vitamins and a special diet. Psychologist Jo Nanson said Tyrell believes the tumour on his thigh bone is not cancerous because his father told him so. He also believes that herbal and vitamin treatments at the Tijuana clinic will make him well again. Nanson said Tyrell s only source of information is his father, who won t permit his son to speak alone with a medical doctor. Nanson also said that Tyrell wouldn t think of disobeying his father. A psychiatrist who talked to Tyrell to find out what he knew about his condition told the court that the boy hasn t received enough medical information.

Ocalan leads a separatist group that has fought for the creation of an independent Kurdistan. Kurds live in lands controlled by Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria. An estimated 20,000 people have died in the fighting of the past 15 years. In London, England, the Greek embassy was temporarily occupied, and hundreds of Kurds are continuing to protest outside the embassy. In Ottawa on Wednesday, Kurdish demonstrators hurled a gasoline bomb at a police line, setting one officer on fire. The group of 400 protesters was fighting with a riot squad outside the Turkish Embassy. In all, 10 police officers were injured in the fighting. In Greece, the foreign minister, the interior minister and the public order minister handed in their resignations because they failed to protect the Kurdish rebel leader. Ocalan was captured earlier this week while hiding in the Greek embassy in Kenya. Turkey considers Ocalan an enemy because he's been fighting an ongoing battle for a separate Kurdish homeland. He could face the death penalty. Ocalan's supporters have been protesting at Turkish, Greek and Israeli embassies in Europe and Canada. On Wednesday, after rumours that Israel helped Turkish securities forces capture Ocalan, angry Kurds tried to occupy the Israeli consulate in Berlin. Israeli guards opened fire on the protesters, killing three and injuring 16 others. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to calm Kurdish anger. But he defends the killings and says his nation had nothing to do with Ocalan's arrest. In Germany, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told the Kurds they must obey German laws and stop violent protests -- or they will be thrown out of the country. In Turkey, police have reportedly arrested hundreds of supporters of the main Kurdish party, while up to 4,000 soldiers have been sent into Northern Iraq to attack Kurdish rebel bases. Ocalan has lived outside Turkey since 1980. In recent months, Turkey has exerted diplomatic pressure on European countries to hand the rebel leader over for trial.

The build-up of these chemicals makes eating Arctic fish and game a frightening and tricky business. The issue came to a head recently as both Canadian aboriginal and federal delegates attended a United Nations conference in Africa. They were seeking to bring attention to the negative effects of globally-produced chemical contaminants on the Arctic food chain. Carole Mills works with the problem daily, both in the contaminants division of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, and as a representative of the Canadian Arctic Indigenous Peoples Against POPs. \"POPS\" are persistent organic pollutants. \"The contamination of animals is confusing and sometimes even alarming, and even my own family members have sometimes stopped eating fish until I could talk to them and explain that the contaminants do concentrate in specific parts, so you don't have to stop eating the animals,\" she says. Ms. Mills says the concentration of chemical pollutants in marine Mammals increases as its position in the food chain gets higher. So micro-organisms carry little contamination; the fish that eat them carry slightly more, and the build-up continues through the chain to include predatory fish, seals, walruses, whales and polar bears and, lastly, humans. Ms. Mills says land-based animals like caribou are very clean. She says it is only the organs and fat of marine mammals that concerned individuals might want to avoid. She says concentrations are bound to be higher in muktuk, a dish made from seal, walrus or whale fat. Ultimately, Ms. Mills stresses a calm, sensible approach. That advice is seconded by Eric Loring, environmental wildlife coordinator with the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada. The Tapirisat is an organization that represents Canadian Inuit. \"We don't really know what the effects of the contamination are, and that's the problem,\" Loring said Thursday. Both Mills and Loring stressed the importance of not scaring people away from country food, while they continue their research and lobbying efforts to turn off the global \"chemical tap.\" \"I would say right now it's more of a health risk to not eat country food than to eat it,\" Loring said, \"because it contains vitamins and nutrients that they would never find in store-bought food.\" Both Mills, who is of Gwich'in descent, and Loring stressed the importance of country food to aboriginal peoples' sense of identity. \"It's important as a cultural activity -- so much so that at the ITC office every day for lunch we have raw seal, fish, caribou or berries,\" said Loring. \"We have access to the same great supermarkets as anyone else in Ottawa, but this is our healthy choice.\" source: Northern News Service"}]}, {"title": "Manitoba Says No Way to YNN", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is the Youth News Network?", "id": "1999-W43-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a news show that airs in some Canadian schools", "answer_start": 24}]}, {"question": "Why does YNN give schools free equipment like televisions and computers?", "id": "1999-W43-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "to make sure it has an audience for its commercial news service", "answer_start": 193}]}, {"question": "How does YNN make a profit?", "id": "1999-W43-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "by selling advertising space", "answer_start": 429}]}, {"question": "How many minutes of commercials are in YNN's 12-minute daily feature?", "id": "1999-W43-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "two and one-half", "answer_start": 371}]}, {"question": "Who said, \"We will not have commercials and products being sold in the classrooms\"?", "id": "1999-W43-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Education Minister Drew Caldwell", "answer_start": 1083}]}, {"question": "What company runs YNN?", "id": "1999-W43-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Montreal-based Athena Educational Partners", "answer_start": 1407}]}, {"question": "Which provinces rejected the idea of having YNN in the classrooms?", "id": "1999-W43-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "British Columbia, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick", "answer_start": 1451}]}, {"question": "On what basis did eight schools in Manitoba agree to show the YNN program?", "id": "1999-W43-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "on a six-month trial basis", "answer_start": 1712}]}], "context": "The Youth News Network, a news show that airs in some Canadian schools, is in trouble in Manitoba.

The move, announced by Manitoba's new NDP government, follows through on a promise the party made in the September provincial election campaign. \"We will not have commercials and products being sold in the classrooms,\" says Education Minister Drew Caldwell. \"We need to ensure more class time - not less - is spent on teaching basics, like physical education and arts, for a more well-rounded education.\" As of the end of June, schools in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland had agreed to show the news program run by Montreal-based Athena Educational Partners.

More than a hockey rink, it's a cultural institution. It may well be the strongest link between Toronto and the rest of Canada. And this weekend, the Gardens are losing the Maple Leafs. For thousands of people from coast to coast to coast, this Saturday is a special hockey night in Canada. It will be the last time the Leafs take to the ice at Maple Leaf Gardens. With the end in sight, the hype -- and mourning -- is beginning in earnest. More than one building in one city, the Gardens has long been a focal point for Canadian culture -- at least for anyone who has ever strapped on the blades. For decades, NHL games were broadcast into living rooms From Plum Coulee, Manitoba to Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia, and beyond from one of two places -- the Gardens or the Montreal Forum. With the end in sight, fond memories are starting to flow. In recent weeks, for example, hockey fans from Western Canada have been making the trek to Toronto to see one last game at the Gardens. Two weeks ago Brent Shuya and his son made the 3-and-a-half hour drive from their home in Russell, Manitoba to Winnipeg. There they hopped on an airplane for another two hour ride to Toronto.  The reason: to see their one and only hockey game at Maple Leaf Gardens. Brent says, \"it was pretty important to me, I wanted my son to go and visit the Gardens, seeing how they are not going to be playing there anymore. I've always been a Leaf fan probably since I was five or six years old and I guess I always will be whether they win or lose, and it was just nice to see them play in their old home.\" But Brent Shuya is by no means the only western hockey fan who has made one final pilgrimage to Maple Leaf Gardens. On his trip he met other fans from the Prairies doing the same thing. There is no one explanation as to why some fans outside Toronto feel such a strong attachment to the Leafs and the building in which they play, although radio and television have had much to do with it. Fans like Winnipeg businessman Jeff Thompson will be at the final game on Saturday. \"The Gardens and the Montreal Forum were both places that although we were never there, as kids growing up we were there,\" he says. \"They came into our house every weekend. It became larger than life because we had grown up watching it\". Winnipeger Bill Juzda was known as one of the toughest players in the NHL when he played for the Leafs in the 1950s. Mr. Juzda expects many of those at the final game Saturday will feel pretty much the way he did when he first walked into Maple Leaf Gardens nearly 50 years ago. He says, \"you walked in and you seen all those pictures in the lobby and everything else. And you stood outside and said, hey, I used to listen to Foster Hewitt on the radio and boy am I lucky to be here.\" Foster Hewitt was the Maple Leafs' radio broadcaster for decades. His voice was known by Canadians from coast to coast. He first broadcast a hockey game on the radio in March, 1923. Decades later he became the Leafs' first television announcer. In Toronto, many residents are sad to see the Leafs abandon the Gardens for the new Air Canada Centre. One fan is Tommy Gaston. For almost 60 years, the 82-year-old and his wife Ruth were in their seats for Leafs home games -- Grey Section West, Seats 13 and 14. After Saturday, the Gastons will have just their fond memories of the Gardens, built in 1931. But Gaston won't have trouble preserving his memories. A self-described pat rack, he has collected enough memorabilia to stock his basement -- and donate the overflow to the Hockey Hall of Fame."}]}, {"title": "Canada's Wartime Guests", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What happened in Europe and England when Geoffrey was nine years old?", "id": "1999-W08-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the Second World War began", "answer_start": 236}]}, {"question": "Where did Geoffrey Dewis live before he was nine?", "id": "1999-W08-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "England", "answer_start": 277}]}, {"question": "How many British children were evacuated under the Commonwealth child evacuation program?", "id": "1999-W08-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "over 2,600", "answer_start": 529}]}, {"question": "Why did CBC produce \"Canada Calling\"?", "id": "1999-W08-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "so that the British kids who were separated from their families could speak to their parents and friends back home over the airwaves", "answer_start": 1338}]}, {"question": "When did Geoffrey Dewis die?", "id": "1999-W08-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "this week", "answer_start": 0}]}, {"question": "Who published Dewis's obituary?", "id": "1999-W08-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the National Post", "answer_start": 10}]}], "context": "This week the National Post newspaper published an obituary of Geoffrey Dewis, a man who died in Vancouver at the age of 69.

His parents feared that Geoffrey and his older sister would be killed in the Nazi bombing of England. But there was a way to keep the kids safe. They took advantage of the Commonwealth child evacuation program.  Over 2,600 British children were sent to live with families in other Commonwealth countries where the war was not raging. Over half of those children -- 1530 of them -- came to live in Canada as guests. Some, like Geoffrey Dewis, returned to Canada to spend the rest of their lives. During the war, the trip to Canada was not easy.  German submarines lurked in the North Atlantic sea where the boats traveled. They fired torpedoes at British and Allied ships. Geoffrey Dewis's ship was the last to arrive safely at its destination.  The next boatload of British kids, on a ship called The City of Benares, was torpedoed and sank. Seventy-seven children on board died. Tragically, that was the end of the \"guest child\" program. During their stay in Canada, CBC Radio produced a program called \"Canada Calling\" so that the British kids who were separated from their families could speak to their parents and friends back home over the airwaves."}]}, {"title": "No Union for Montreal McDonald's", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How many McDonald's restaurants are there in North America?", "id": "1999-W09-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "15,000", "answer_start": 1127}]}, {"question": "Where is the only unionized McDonald's in North America?", "id": "1999-W09-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Squamish, British Columbia", "answer_start": 186}]}, {"question": "When was the McDonald's unionized?", "id": "1999-W09-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "last August", "answer_start": 1210}]}, {"question": "What happened when the Teamsters tried to unionize a McDonald's in Montreal?", "id": "1999-W09-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "workers voted against becoming members of a trade union", "answer_start": 60}]}, {"question": "According to their Quebec office, how did McDonald's feel about the vote to unionize the Montreal franchise?", "id": "1999-W09-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "they welcomed the vote", "answer_start": 796}]}, {"question": "Why did the St-Hubert McDonald's not get unionized?", "id": "1999-W09-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "it got shut down just as the union was about to be certified", "answer_start": 1371}]}], "context": "Workers at a McDonald's restaurant in Montreal, Quebec have voted against becoming members of a trade union.

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters had been trying to organize the workers for 16 months. Rejean Lavigne, head of the Teamsters local behind the campaign, said almost all of the original employees who signed union cards in 1997 had quit and the new ones, some as young as 16, didn't want a union. \"If we lose, well, we can't do anything more,\" Lavigne said before the vote was tallied. \"If the employees don't want us there, what are you going to do?\" A statement from McDonald's Quebec regional office welcomed the vote. \"We believe that giving all the employees in the outlet the opportunity to determine the outcome of this matter was the fairest and most responsible way to resolve the question of union representation,\" the statement said. The McDonald's in Squamish became the first unionized outlet among the chain's more than 15,000 outlets in North America when the Canadian Auto Workers made a breakthrough last August. Rejection of the union in Montreal was the second failure for the Teamsters against the chain. Last year, a franchise in suburban St-Hubert, Quebec shut down just as the union was about to be certified. The latest loss means an end to a campaign begun last year to unionize at least one McDonald's in every major city across Canada, which has so far cost the Teamsters about $100,000. Union officials in Quebec say lengthy delays used by employers to fight certification played into McDonald's hands by discouraging its young employees. \"We received petitions saying thank you for the good work but we don't need you any more,\" Lavigne said. \"The workers fired us in effect.\""}]}, {"title": "Doctors say kids watch too much TV", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What new question are Canadian pediatricians considering asking parents during a child's checkup?", "id": "1999-W35-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "How much television do your kids watch?", "answer_start": 626}]}, {"question": "Why does the Canadian Pediatric Society want doctors to monitor how much time children are sitting in front of electronic screens?", "id": "1999-W35-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "because excessive and inappropriate exposure can harm a child's physical, mental and social skills", "answer_start": 796}]}, {"question": "How much time should school children spend watching TV each day?", "id": "1999-W35-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "no more than two hours", "answer_start": 1004}]}, {"question": "At their current viewing rates, who will spend more time watching TV than they will in the classroom?", "id": "1999-W35-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the average high school graduate", "answer_start": 1061}]}, {"question": "According to pediatricians, there is a relationship between watching television and an increase in what kind of behaviour?", "id": "1999-W35-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "violent", "answer_start": 1296}]}, {"question": "When do pediatricians say the TV should be turned off?", "id": "1999-W35-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "during meal times", "answer_start": 1980}]}, {"question": "How much time does the average Canadian kid spend watching television each week?", "id": "1999-W35-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "23 hours", "answer_start": 100}]}], "context": "How much time does the average Canadian kid spend watching television each week? 5 hours? 10 hours? 23 hours? If you answered 23 hours, you're right. By the time most of you finish high school, you will have spent more time listening to actors than teachers. A new study shows Canadian kids are spending almost one full day a week glued to their television screens. And many doctors think there are several reasons why too much TV is not good for kids. A group representing Canadian pediatricians - doctors who specialize in treating children - may have a new question for parents when they take their children for a checkup: How much television do your kids watch? The Canadian Pediatric Society wants doctors to monitor how much time children are sitting in front of electronic screens. That's because excessive and inappropriate exposure can harm a child's physical, mental and social skills. The society wants parents to limit preschoolers to one hour of TV a day, while school children should watch no more than two hours daily. At current Canadian rates, the average high school graduate will have spent more time watching TV than they did learning in a classroom. Pediatricians say that not all television is bad. But there is a relationship between watching television and an increase in violent behaviour. The pediatricians believe television viewing frequently limits children's time to develop vital activities such as playing, reading, learning to talk, spending time with friends and family, storytelling, getting regular exercise, and developing other physical, mental and social skills. They also believe that too much time in front of the TV may contribute to childhood obesity. The pediatricians have come up with a list of ways of promoting good television viewing habits. Among the suggested habits are recommendations for parents to watch television with their children and discuss the programs. The pediatricians also believe televisions should be turned off during meal times."}]}, {"title": "A Step to Curing Diabetes", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How many Canadians have diabetes and don't realize it?", "id": "1999-W20-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "more than 750,00", "answer_start": 1183}]}, {"question": "What kinds of health problems do diabetics potentially face?", "id": "1999-W20-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "blindness, circulatory problems, heart disease and kidney failure", "answer_start": 757}]}, {"question": "How is diabetes currently controlled?", "id": "1999-W20-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "proper diet, exercise and insulin", "answer_start": 833}]}, {"question": "What does insulin do for our bodies?", "id": "1999-W20-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "helps the body properly use sugers", "answer_start": 1531}]}, {"question": "What do Type 1 diabetics' immune systems do to insulin-producing cells?", "id": "1999-W20-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "attacks them", "answer_start": 1471}]}, {"question": "Where does Dr. Yoon's team work?", "id": "1999-W20-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the University of Calgary", "answer_start": 239}]}, {"question": "Why will diabetics have to be patient, despite Dr. Ji-Won Yoon's discovery?", "id": "1999-W20-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a cure for humans is between five and 10 years away", "answer_start": 387}]}, {"question": "Who is Holly McWilliams?", "id": "1999-W20-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": " a diabetic", "answer_start": 1444}]}], "context": "A team of Calgary researchers says that they have discovered one of the causes of diabetes. The scientists have spent the last eight years in the lab trying to pinpoint the immune system's role in diabetes. Dr. Ji-Won Yoon and his team at the University of Calgary say their research gives insight into what triggers insulin-dependent diabetes. But, diabetics will have to be patient -- a cure for humans is between five and 10 years away. However, that didn't temper the enthusiasm of diabetic Holly McWilliams. \"This is very exciting,\" said the 18-year-old Calgarian who has had to inject insulin four times a day since she was three years old to stay alive. She now uses an insulin pump to maintain proper levels of the hormone. Diabetics are at risk of blindness, circulatory problems, heart disease and kidney failure, but with proper diet, exercise and insulin, it can be controlled. There are at least two strands of diabetes: Type 1 -- when the body doesn't produce insulin. Type 2 -- when insulin in the body doesn't work properly. Dr. Ji-Won Yoon's discovery affects Type 1 diabetics, which inflicts about 100,000 Canadians. One and a half million Canadians have diabetes; more than 750,000 have it and don't know it. \"This is a major landmark study and it helps us understand the disease in a way we haven't in the past,\" says Dr. David Lau of the Julia McFarlane Diabetes Research Centre. Dr. Yoon's research on mice focuses on how a diabetic's immune system attacks cells that produce insulin, which is needed to help the body properly use sugars. A protein in the pancreas, which produces insulin, plays a critical role in triggering diabetes in mice. Destruction of insulin-producing cells by the immune system can be prevented by halting protein production. Dr. Yoon said his work could lead to transplants of tissue that fight the sugar build-up process or possibly a vaccine. Lau is confident studies on mice will also work on humans."}]}, {"title": "Nova Scotia School Pumps Up", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where is South Queens Junior High School located?", "id": "1999-W02-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Liverpool, Nova Scotia", "answer_start": 19}]}, {"question": "Who is the principal of South Queens Junior High School?", "id": "1999-W02-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Betty Jean Aucoin", "answer_start": 570}]}, {"question": "What has South Queens Junior High School done with its old metal shop?", "id": "1999-W02-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "turned it into a fitness club", "answer_start": 239}]}, {"question": "Who runs the club?", "id": "1999-W02-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a non-profit society", "answer_start": 425}]}, {"question": "How big is the club?", "id": "1999-W02-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "12,000 square feet", "answer_start": 1442}]}, {"question": "If you were a student, how much would a club membership cost you?", "id": "1999-W02-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "$135 a year", "answer_start": 1639}]}], "context": "A middle school in Liverpool, Nova Scotia is pumping up bodies as well as minds.

The club, operated by a non-profit society made up of school and community volunteers, has sold more than 30 memberships and hired a full-time co-ordinator.

She held the Yugoslav President personally responsible, along with four of his aides, for the horrors in Kosovo and the brutal purge of ethnic Albanians. It appears to be no coincidence that Ms. McLellan announced the appointment the day after NATO and Yugoslav generals signed a detailed military agreement on the withdrawal of Yugoslav and Serb forces from Kosovo.

The Melissa virus spreads via Microsoft's widely used Word 97 and Word 2000 documents, which can be attached to e-mail messages, as well as Microsoft's Outlook and Outlook Express e-mail program. If a computer user opens the infected Word document, the virus propagates itself by reading the user's e-mail address book and sends an infected message to the first 50 entries.

The money will come from taxpayers. NHL teams like the Ottawa Senators and the Edmonton Oilers have said for years that they are going broke. They have threatened to move to the United States - where they say business is better - unless the government helps them out. Yesterday Industry Minister John Manley finally agreed. He has given the go-ahead to negotiate subsidies (money given to help out) on a team-by-team basis. Some teams will get more. Others will get less. The subsidies could add up to millions of dollars. The reaction to the program has been very mixed. In the Montreal Canadiens dressing room, winger Turner Stevenson of Prince George, British Columbia, is very happy. \"People see it as the government giving us free money, but look how much tax we pay,\" he says. \"Guys make a million, but they pay half of that in taxes.\" The average NHL player makes 1.3 million dollars a season. But Olympic 100 metre sprinter Glenroy Gilbert is disgusted. He says that it is not fair that millionaire hockey players like Turner Stevenson and Pavel Bure are getting help while hundreds of Olympic athletes have to scramble every month just to pay their bills. \"I've been doing this for 13 or 14 years, running on the national team and we've been forced to live on from $450 a month to $810 a month,\" Gilbert said from Austin, Texas, where he is training for the Sydney Olympics. \"That barely pays your rent.\" Other groups are equally upset.

She also knows firsthand how hard it is for farm families to make a living. Reports of crisis on Canadian farms first became national news in the Fall of 1998. Government aid was promised to struggling farmers trying to keep their farms running. The crunch was particularly felt in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, among hog and grain farmers. But instead of complaining, Amanda is going on stage. This Sunday she's going to be singing in Toronto, Ontario, with some of the best-known names in Canadian music. It is called The Family Farm Tribute. The concert is meant to open people's eyes to the growing farm crisis in Canada. The lineup for the concert includes Gordon Lightfoot, Burton Cummings, Sylvia Tyson, Kevin Parent, Fred Penner and Sharon, Lois and Bram, as well as bands such as Wide Mouth Mason and Big Sugar. \"I know with my Dad the stress of not being able to get the crops in, it builds up, you know?\", says Amanda. \"And then also it's the pressure of continuing on with what your forefathers have started on the family farm.\" The concert is being organized by Liberal Member of Parliament Dennis Mills. He says the concert will achieve two things. It will bring rural problems to the attention of an urban audience, and it will show the country that Toronto cares. \"People beyond the 416 area code [the area code for Toronto], especially in the West, tend to think we are an evil, uncaring, don't-give-a-damn-kind of community. I know that's not the case and I think an event like this brings us together as a nation.\" The concert's not a sell-out yet. There were still 3,000 tickets available as of yesterday afternoon. Even if it's not packed to the rafters, Mills says the concert's message will still get out as people across the country can tune into the event live on CBC Newsworld. Federal Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief and his provincial counterparts are meeting today in Ottawa, Ontario, to work out a new aid package for cash-strapped farmers. It could be worth as much as $1 billion.

He believes Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms means that Canadians are free to beg if they want to. The Charter sets out the laws that govern the legal rights of Canadian citizens. Sean's launching a Charter challenge against Ottawa's anti-panhandling laws after he was ticketed for begging on the street. Sean used to beg on a patch of downtown Ottawa sidewalk, wedged between a bank and a grocery store. He sat on the ground, silent, with a hat in front of him. Police often asked him to move. In March, he got a $50 ticket -- and decided to take it to court. This is the first time an individual has challenged begging laws in court. It could be a landmark case, one with consequences for a number of Canadian cities that restrict or ban panhandling. \"What I was doing wasn't wrong, there was nothing wrong with it. I wasn't harassing anyone. And I think I live in a place where people have the right to give charity first-hand,\" Sean told Carla Hilton, a reporter for CBC radio news. Lawyer Mark Ertle plans to challenge the law on two counts -- it restricts freedom of expression, and security of the person, individual freedoms guaranteed under the Charter. \"You can understand that the police would see it was sort of fruitless to charge people who are begging with an offence for which they're going to receive a fine, which they can never pay anyway. And so while a lot of people aren't charged, I think the police do use the law to clear the streets,\" Mr. Ertle says. Here's what the Charter says: Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms: Freedom of conscience and religion; Freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication; Freedom of peaceful assembly; and Freedom of association. The Charter guarantees certain freedoms for everyone in Canada. Under section 2 of the Charter, Canadians are guaranteed freedom of thought, belief and expression. Since the media are an important means for communicating thoughts and ideas, the Charter also protects the right of the press and other media to speak out. Canadian traditions and laws have reflected the freedoms set out in section 2 for many years. Since 1982, the Charter has given these freedoms constitutional protection. These freedoms are set out in the Charter to ensure that Canadians are free to create and to express their ideas, gather to discuss them and communicate them widely to other people. These activities are basic forms of individual liberty. They are also important to the success of a democratic society like Canada. In a democracy, people must be free to discuss matters of public policy, criticize governments and offer their own solutions to social problems. Even though these freedoms are very important, governments can sometimes limit them. For example, laws against pornography and hate propaganda are reasonable limits on freedom of expression because they prevent harm to individuals and groups. Sean's court case is still a few weeks away. But people with an interest in issues like democratic rights and poverty are watching the Ottawa case closely. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the National Anti-Poverty Organization have both expressed interest in going before the court to explain their positions."}]}, {"title": "Religious Battles Over Movies", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why did some members of the Hindu religion destroy the sets for the movie, Water, by Deepa Mehta?", "id": "2000-W05-4-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "they accuse Mehta of insulting Hindu traditions", "answer_start": 199}]}, {"question": "What are the other two films in Mehta's trilogy?", "id": "2000-W05-4-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Earth and Fire", "answer_start": 425}]}, {"question": "From whom did Mehta obtain permission to shoot the film Water?", "id": "2000-W05-4-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the Indian federal Information and Broadcasting Ministry and the government of the state where the film is being shot", "answer_start": 563}]}, {"question": "What are fundamentalists?", "id": "2000-W05-4-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "strongly religious people who refuse anything that disagrees with their faith", "answer_start": 662}]}, {"question": "Where was the film Water being shot?", "id": "2000-W05-4-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Varanasi", "answer_start": 819}]}, {"question": "How much money did the attack cost the production of the movie?", "id": "2000-W05-4-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "about a million dollars", "answer_start": 1076}]}, {"question": "What was Mehta's film, Fire, about?", "id": "2000-W05-4-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the relationship of two women caught in unhappy marriages", "answer_start": 1278}]}, {"question": "When was India partitioned?", "id": "2000-W05-4-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1947", "answer_start": 1408}]}, {"question": "Who organized huge protests that forced the British to hand over power?", "id": "2000-W05-4-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Mahatma Ghandi", "answer_start": 1565}]}], "context": "Canadian film maker Deepa Mehta is finding out that making a movie in India is never easy.

Water is the third in a controversial trilogy (a set of three) of films by the Indian-born film maker. Her other two films were entitled Earth and Fire. Mehta had obtained permission to shoot the film from the Indian federal Information and Broadcasting Ministry, as well as the government of the state where the film is being shot. But after the attack by fundamentalists (strongly religious people who refuse anything that disagrees with their faith), Indian government authorities withdrew their permission to shoot the film in Varanasi. Varanasi is considered one of India's oldest and most religious cities. Now, after a meeting with the federal Information and Broadcasting minister, Mehta has been given permission to resume shooting. Mehta says the attack has cost the production about a million dollars in damage and delays in the shooting schedule. Last year, Mehta's film, Fire, was pulled from theatres in India after violent protests by Hindu nationalists. That film was about the relationship of two women caught in unhappy marriages. Earth treated another controversial subject: the partition of India in 1947. Beginning in 1858, India was ruled by the British. Many millions of Indians did not want to be a British Colony. They wanted to run their own country. Mahatma Gandhi organized huge protest marches, which forced Britain to hand over power. But when they did so they divided the country into two - India in the south, where a majority of the population believes in the Hindu religion, and Pakistan in the north, where the majority of the population believes in the Muslim religion.

Over a decade-long, storybook career, the Mabou, Nova Scotia family band rose from playing at county fairs and church halls to become the most successful music acts on the East Coast through the 1990s. The five siblings sold more than two million records, won five Juno Awards, including group of the year in 1994, and took its Celtic music to the world.

She is applying to be accepted as a refugee to Canada. She was on one of the boats from China that was intercepted by the Coast Guard off the coast of British Columbia earlier this year. According to international law, a refugee is a person who has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to be protected by his own country. The Chinese woman can't be identified because of a legal order, but it seems her claim to be accepted as a refugee to Canada may succeed where the claims of 32 people who arrived with her have failed. They will be sent back to China. The woman says that seven years ago she got pregnant for the second time. That violates a Chinese law. Couples in China are only allowed to have one child. She tried to hide from the authorities, but they found her when she was eight months pregnant and took her to hospital. She said through an interpreter, \"The baby was born alive. They put the baby in a bucket. I heard the baby crying for a short time and I wanted to hold the baby but I couldn't. Later, the doctor told me the baby was no longer living.\" When she heard a ship was going to Canada, she decided to get on board. She planned to seek refugee status and bring her husband and child. So far, every refugee claim from the Chinese migrants has been rejected, usually because the board has found no evidence of persecution. This case may be different. The woman also says her family received a notice that she'll be sterilized so she can't have any more babies if she returns to China. Larry Smeets, her lawyer, says the Federal Court of Appeal has concluded in the past that forced sterilization was a form of persecution, so this reason could be recognized as a reason for refugees to be allowed to remain in Canada. Since there is little evidence beyond the woman's own testimony, the decision depends on whether the board members believe she is telling the truth."}]}, {"title": "Sarah McLachlan Wins Court Case", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How did McLachlan feel about the suit being thrown out?", "id": "1999-W51-1-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "very relieved", "answer_start": 161}]}, {"question": "Who dismissed the lawsuit?", "id": "1999-W51-1-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Bruce Cohen", "answer_start": 193}]}, {"question": "Where did McLachlan move from?", "id": "1999-W51-1-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Halifax, Nova Scotia", "answer_start": 556}]}, {"question": "Why was Bruce Neudorf hired, according to McLachlan?", "id": "1999-W51-1-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "to help McLachlan pursue a career as a recording artist", "answer_start": 581}]}, {"question": "What did Neudorf claim he did not receive from McLachlan?", "id": "1999-W51-1-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "proper royalties for producing \"Touch\"", "answer_start": 813}]}, {"question": "How many copies of the album \"Touch\" were sold?", "id": "1999-W51-1-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "625,000", "answer_start": 874}]}, {"question": "What concert series did McLachlan mastermind?", "id": "1999-W51-1-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Lilith Fair", "answer_start": 1253}]}, {"question": "What did McLachlan occasionally do during the trial?", "id": "1999-W51-1-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "sang and played keyboard", "answer_start": 1437}]}], "context": "A Vancouver, British Columbia, judge has thrown out a copyright lawsuit against Canadian pop singer Sarah McLachlan.

The rampage began just before noon as the two boys in black trench coats and black masks walked into the school, armed with guns and explosives. One witness said they seemed to be shooting at random and shouting that they were seeking \"revenge.\" For hours, students inside the building hid in fear for their lives. Some students took cover the school's choir room and were able to stay in touch with police by using their cell phones. Students have said that the teacher who shepherded the students into the choir room is a hero. Hours later, the gunmen were found dead in the library. Columbine high school is in the middle-class part of Littleton, population 35,000. It opened in 1973 and has an enrollment of about 1,800. Authorities said they were able to clear 90 per cent of the students out of the building almost immediately. The rest were cleared out after the shooting stopped. Because of the shooting, Colorado lawmakers have put off adopting a law that would help gun owners carry concealed weapons. The bill's sponsor, Representative Doug, says the Columbine school tragedy might have been offset if a faculty member or administrator had been armed. But Representative Russell George says he's getting e-mail from people saying \"see what happens when you have guns?\" Canadians are not allowed to carry concealed guns except in special cases."}]}, {"title": "A Sad Groundhog Day", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who is Wiarton Willie?", "id": "1999-W06-2-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the famous Canadian groundhog who predicted the arrival of spring", "answer_start": 16}]}, {"question": "What happened to him two days before Groundhog day?", "id": "1999-W06-2-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "he died", "answer_start": 17}]}, {"question": "Who took care of Willie?", "id": "1999-W06-2-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Sam Brouwer", "answer_start": 296}]}, {"question": "How old was Willie when he died?", "id": "1999-W06-2-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "22", "answer_start": 558}]}, {"question": "When will he be buried?", "id": "1999-W06-2-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the spring", "answer_start": 676}]}, {"question": "Where did Willie live?", "id": "1999-W06-2-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a hutch", "answer_start": 929}]}, {"question": "Who claims to have received a message from Willie's spirit?", "id": "1999-W06-2-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Al Given", "answer_start": 729}]}], "context": "Wiarton Willie, the famous Canadian groundhog who predicted the arrival of spring, died in his sleep of natural causes on Sunday, two days before Groundhog's Day.

His paws were crossed, his eyelids had pennies on them and he held a carrot. Brouwer said Willie was 22 years old, which is three times longer than the average age a groundhog survives in the wild. He will be buried in the spring. But Willie did make one more prediction. Al Given, mayor of South Bruce Peninsula, said that Willie's spirit told him that it would be an early spring. A search will begin to find Willie's son, who will take over Willie's duties and home -- a hutch in the front yard of a motel south of Wiarton. Wiarton Willie had done the job over the last decade. If the sun was shining when Willie peeked his head out, it meant six more weeks of cold weather. If it was cloudy, Willie couldn't see his shadow, which meant spring would come early. Punxsutawney Phil, another famous groundhog who lives in Pennsylvania, did not see his shadow this morning.

The NATO troops are there to make sure that Yugoslavian soldiers leave the area. At least 10,000 Serbian soldiers and police have already left, along with all Serb military aircraft. But as NATO troops pour into the province, many of its residents feel they must leave. Clutching teddy bears, pet dogs and rifles, citizens of Serbian heritage streamed out of Prizren, Kosovo's second-largest city today. Many of them are afraid of the anger of their neighbours of Albanian heritage. They fear that when the ethnic Albanians return to the area now that the war is over, they may try to take revenge on the ethnic Serbs. With belongings lashed to the top of their cars, the new refugees said they were heading northwards to the Kosovo capital of Pristina or all the way to Serbia itself. Many were lifelong residents of Prizren. \"We don't know where we are going. NATO can't guarantee our safety,\" said one man, his family gathered around a packed car as it prepared to join waves of people that began leaving today. \"War is terrible,\" said a mother, her daughter preparing to put the family dog Licky into one of a line of cars jamming a cobblestone hillside street. On a nearby square, passengers climbed aboard a bus bound for Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital. There was no harassment from ethnic Albanian residents of Prizren, who like others across Kosovo, say they suffered looting, humiliation and expulsion at the hands of the Serb military and police. \"This is not a fight between Albanians and Serbs. We have long lived together. Many of us wept when they were forced to leave,\" said the theology professor. \"This is the politics of communism, of President Slobodan Milosevic.\" Thirteen hundred Canadian soldiers will participate in the occupation of Kosovo. Five hundred of them come from the Princess Patricia Canadian Light Infantry in Edmonton. They will serve with a British armoured brigade. Canadian troops are as well serving on a ship, the HMCS Athabascan, which is sailing in the Adriatic Sea, just off the coast of Yugoslavia. NATO spokesman Jamie Shea says troop deployment is going \"very smoothly\" and is slightly ahead of schedule. He says Yugoslav troops are sticking to their timetable for leaving the area and should be out of the southern sector of Kosovo by tomorrow's deadline.

The Tibetan flag was hung on City Hall Flagpole before the Chinese Premier arrived. \"I was advised through contacts in the business community that if the flag was not lowered, Zhu would cancel his trip to Saint John's,\" said Mayor Andy Wells. \"It shows how insecure they must be that they'd be sensitive to a flag flying in a city of 150,000 people, 50,000 miles from China.\" Zhu's plane landed in a shroud of thick fog in Saint John's Wednesday night. It was the beginning of a six-day, six-city Canadian tour that will emphasize trade and environmental issues. The premier arrived in Canada after wrapping up a nine-day visit to the United States. China's record on human rights often dogged Zhu during the U.S. leg of his trip and is expected to follow him north. Zhu, accompanied by a delegation of about 150 people, was greeted by Newfoundland Premier Brian Tobin. About 120 Chinese , many of them school-age children or students at Memorial University, also turned out to wave Chinese and Canadian flags and shout greetings. A banner read \"Warmly welcome Premier Zhu Rongji to visit Canada.\" On Tuesday, Wells granted a local group permission to fly the Tibetan flag at City Hall for the duration of Mr. Zhu's visit as a show of protest against the country's human rights record. In Ottawa, Sean Rowan, a spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs, confirmed the Chinese delegation complained about the flying of the Tibetan flag. He said federal officials explained that Canada is a free country and that flying the flag was a decision of the City of Saint John's and in no way represented Ottawa's policy. Rowan said the Chinese concerns were passed on to provincial officials just the same. Wells said he will not present Zhu with the keys to the city, a tradition usually accorded visiting dignitaries. It's just one small protest to remind the Canadian government that not all Canadians support pandering to China for business contracts,\" said Wells, who is a member of Amnesty International. \"Some people believe that human rights is not just a western custom.\" He also said Calgary, Alberta Mayor Al Duerr's decision to present a white cowboy hat, Calgary's symbol of hospitality, to Zhu was \"shameful\" and \"unacceptable.\" Duerr shrugged off the criticism. \"It's easy to throw stones when you're sitting on a rock,\" he said, adding the white hat has nothing to do with politics. \"When the white hat becomes a political symbol, we will stop giving it out.\" Canadian activists, meanwhile, want Prime Minister Jean Chretien to speak out forcefully when the politically-powerful Zhu arrives in Ottawa, Ontario later today. James Pilgram of the Canada-Tibet Committee said flying the Tibetan flag in Saint John's was meant to be a peaceful sign of protest. After Tibet's failed 1959 uprising against the Chinese, the Dalai Lama and 120,000 followers fled their Himalayan homes for what has become a lifelong exile, mostly in India and Nepal. There are smaller Tibetan communities in Switzerland, the United States and Canada. China effectively annexed Tibet after the revolt and declared it a Chinese province. Several demonstrations cantering around the Tibet issue occurred during Zhu's U.S. visit. During a protest earlier Wednesday in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a flag-waving pro-Chinese demonstrator was knocked down after he got close to a group of about 100 pro-Tibet protesters who were chanting \"Shame on China.\" The protesters grabbed the flag from the man and burned it. Following a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Zhu responded to questions about a prominent dissident by saying human rights in China have improved. He acknowledged some shortcomings, however. \"We wish to establish a nation which is ruled in accordance with law,\" he said. \"As for any individual case, I don't think this is the appropriate time to go into details.\" Before leaving for Ottawa Thursday, Zhu met with Tobin and his cabinet.

The water contains higher than acceptable levels of chemicals known as trihalomethanes or THMs. These potentially dangerous chemicals have been linked to cancer and miscarriages (failed pregnancies). They are formed when tiny amounts of chlorine are added to drinking water. Chlorine - also known as \"bleach\" - is also added to the water in many swimming pools. You've no doubt noticed the smell. The danger of trihalomethanes in drinking water is faced mainly by small towns that can't afford expensive water filtration systems. Chlorination is necessary for two reasons. First, almost all sources of water contain microbiological organisms which have to be removed to prevent the outbreak of diseases such as typhoid fever and cholera. Second, once the treated water leaves the treatment plant, it travels through water pipes. During this trip, from the plant to your tap, it is necessary to have a disinfectant in the water to guard against the regrowth of microorganisms. Nova Scotia also recently identified 18 communities with unacceptably high levels of trihalomethanes. Newfoundland's environment minister says he plans to hire an expert who will look into reducing the amount of THMs in the water supply. In the meantime, Oliver Langdon says people shouldn't panic. \"People should not be alarmed about this matter. The benefits of disinfecting our water far outweigh the health effects of THMs.\" Many Newfoundland residents are upset with the government. They say the government has known there were problems but hid the facts from the public. Fogo town manager Bruce Pomeroy says that the government \"should have made everyone aware if there were risks -- like they are doing now -- two years ago.\" There are easy ways of getting rid of many of the THMs in drinking water. You can leave water in an open container for 24 hours, and many of the chemicals will evaporate. You can also pour the water through a charcoal-based water filter, like the popular ones many people keep in the fridge. The charcoal will absorb the chemicals."}]}, {"title": "Harbour home of the Bluenose faces sewage problem", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who do town officials want to help clean up the harbour?", "id": "1999-W33-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the federal and provincial governments", "answer_start": 344}]}, {"question": "Why do so many people want to visit Lunenberg?", "id": "1999-W33-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "because the town is a United Nations World Heritage Site", "answer_start": 449}]}, {"question": "When was the first International Fisherman's Trophy race held?", "id": "1999-W33-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1920", "answer_start": 815}]}, {"question": "How did the International Fisherman's Trophy race start?", "id": "1999-W33-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "as a friendly competition between US and Canadian fishing schooners", "answer_start": 832}]}, {"question": "How many times did the Bluenose win the International Fisherman's Trophy race?", "id": "1999-W33-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "four", "answer_start": 989}]}, {"question": "Where did the Bluenose sink?", "id": "1999-W33-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "in the Caribbean Sea", "answer_start": 1131}]}, {"question": "Where has a picture of the Bluenose appeared since 1937?", "id": "1999-W33-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "on the tails side of Canadian dimes", "answer_start": 1369}]}, {"question": "What is the Bluenose II?", "id": "1999-W33-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a replica of the original Bluenose", "answer_start": 1436}]}, {"question": "How much of the cleanup cost for Lunenberg Harbor does the mayor of Lunenberg want the federal and provincial governments to pay?", "id": "1999-W33-5-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "half", "answer_start": 1880}]}], "context": "Lunenburg Harbour, one of Canada's most famous ports, is facing an unpleasant problem.

Many people come to visit Lunenburg because the town is a United Nations World Heritage Site. It's a distinction it shares with only one other Canadian city, Old Quebec. Lunenburg Harbour is famous for being the home of the Bluenose and the Bluenose II. The Bluenose was a famous schooner ship that raced for the International Fisherman's Trophy. The first International Fisherman's Trophy race was in 1920. It started as a friendly competition between US and Canadian fishing schooners. The Bluenose was one of the most successful racing schooners. The Bluenose won the race four times. In 1942, the Bluenose was sold to carry freight and cargo to the West Indies. In January 1946, it went down after striking a reef in the Caribbean Sea. In 1955, both the Bluenose and its captain, Angus Walters, were inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame for their achievements in the International Fisherman's Trophy races. A picture of the Bluenose has been on the tails side of Canadian dimes since 1937. The Bluenose II is a replica of the original Bluenose. It was built from the same plans, in the same shipyard, and by some of the same men who built the original. The Bluenose and Lunenburg are important parts of Canadian history. This is why the sewage is a concern. The Mayor says the federal government agreed to help maintain the area when Lunenburg applied for UN World Heritage Site status. Now the Mayor wants the federal and provincial governments to pay half the cost of cleaning up Lunenburg Harbour. The Mayor says increasing people's taxes to pay for the cleanup is not the answer. The Mayor also admits that federal and provincial governments shouldn't normally help pay for a community's sewage treatment.

This is important because sport fishing for small mouth bass, walleye and lake trout is a multi-million dollar industry. The round goby is about the size of a sardine. It is dangerous because it leaves almost no food for other fish. It eats the eggs and young of the sport fish and chases larger fish away from food sources, leaving little for them to eat. The round goby also has the advantage of being able to feed right through the night. It can do this because it has special sensors. The Fisheries and Oceans Department says the round goby makes life miserable for fishers too, because they steal bait and will also hit lures. In many cases, the fishermen are finding that all they can catch are goby. The round goby came from the Black Sea, likely in water held in the bottom of a boat. The fish is already well established in Lake Erie and Lake Superior. Officials hope to prevent it from spreading into other Canadian lakes and rivers. The Fisheries and Oceans Department says people can help control the goby population by not using the fish as bait, and by not transferring them from one body of water to another.

And it's got nothing to do with what students are watching in their spare time at home. It's about teens having to watch commercials in school. Every day. It's a controversy about the growing commercialization of schools. Youth News Network, a private news and current-affairs network, has installed a satellite dish and thousands of dollars worth of televisions and audio-visual equipment at Meadowvale Secondary School free of charge. It expects to start broadcasting its 12-minute newscast -- complete with 2 1/2 minutes of commercials -- every day to the school's 1,700 students starting in September. But along with the bonanza of technology, the school is inheriting a political hot potato. \"I happen to believe that it is completely unacceptable to sell off little bits of our kids,\" said Heather-Jane Robertson, director of professional development with the Canadian Teachers Federation. \"If we don't understand that it's wrong to sell off our kids to advertisers, to compromise public education in that way, then we can hardly turn around and blame the people who want to make money off our stupidity.\" Some educators say YNN serves as an example of the wave of commercialization sweeping over schools at a time when funding cuts are forcing public boards to look to businesses for help. While public broadcasters such as CBC Newsworld and TV Ontario provide programming free of charge to schools, none can come close to providing the wealth of televisions, VCRs, computers, and video cameras installed at Meadowvale under its pilot project with YNN's owner, Montreal-based Athena Educational Partners Inc. Meadowvale principal Laurie Pedwell conceded that the technology was part of YNN's appeal. But she insisted that the sample broadcast viewed by students last November was balanced and suitably tailored to teenagers. As for the advertisements, she said none was offensive or aggressively pushing a product, and most depicted teenagers positively. The school has a June deadline to decide whether it wants to sign a five-year contract with YNN. Stephanie Lake is a grade twelve student at Meadowvale secondary. She recently wrote this essay about YNN coming to her school. \"We may be teenagers, but we're not all couch potatoes!  Well, at least we weren't. Who knows, maybe one day soon, secondary school students all across Canada will be the same - walking, brainwashed zombies.

President Clinton was acquitted of the charge of perjury (lying in court) and of obstructing justice (hiding evidence, or getting others to lie in court). Both are very serious offences. If found guilty, Clinton would have been removed as president of the United States. The Senate, which is made up of 100 senators, needed 67 votes to impeach Clinton on either charge. The senators were split 50-50 on the charge of obstruction of justice, and only 45 voted Clinton \"guilty\" on the charge of perjury. There are two parties in the Senate, the Democrats and the Republicans. The Republicans are the majority with 55 seats. They were for the impeachment, but in order to get 67 votes, they needed some of the Democrats to support them. The Democrats, however, felt that there wasn't enough public support to remove the president from office. And they were right. Although most Americans believe Clinton acted immorally, they don't think his actions were serious enough to impeach him. They grew very weary of the impeachment. In fact, Clinton's approval rating climbed during the trial, which means Americans think he is still fit to be their president. Clinton had denied having an affair with White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, but later admitted that he did have a relationship with her. It was his attempts to hide it that led to the charges against him. Republican senators claim Clinton tried to get Lewinsky to lie, but she says it was her own decision to cover up the affair. After the trial, Clinton said he was \"profoundly sorry\" for how he handled the situation."}]}, {"title": "The State of Texas Executes Canadian", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "When was the last time a Canadian was executed in the United States?", "id": "1999-W25-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1952", "answer_start": 177}]}, {"question": "Of which province in Canada was Stanley Faulder a native?", "id": "1999-W25-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Alberta", "answer_start": 103}]}, {"question": "What would a stay of execution have allowed?", "id": "1999-W25-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Faulder's lawyer to continue her quest to allow him to live", "answer_start": 475}]}, {"question": "How was Faulder killed?", "id": "1999-W25-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "by an injection of deadly chemicals", "answer_start": 850}]}, {"question": "What has Charlene Gingera been working with the Faulder family to do since 1997", "id": "1999-W25-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "to try to get human rights groups interested in his case", "answer_start": 1990}]}, {"question": "Why did Texas Governor George W.

After 22 years on death row, the Alberta native became the first Canadian to be executed in the U.S. since 1952. He was sentenced to death for the 1975 murder of a Texas woman. A last-minute appeal to the Supreme Court to stop the execution was rejected, and Texas Governor George W. Bush said he would not issue a stay of execution. A \"stay of execution\" delays the execution, and would have allowed Mr. Faulder's lawyer to continue her quest to allow him to live. The United States placed itself above international law, says a friend of the late man's family. \"The United States is one of our world leaders and world powers, and yet they allow the basic human rights of people to be violated in their own country,\" said Charlene Gingera, about an hour after Faulder was killed by an injection of deadly chemicals. Ms. Gingera spoke on behalf of family members who wanted to grieve Faulder's death privately. She was referring to the fact that both Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy and his U.S. counterpart, Madeleine Albright, agreed Faulder was denied his international rights because Texas officials failed to tell Canadian diplomats that he was in jail. Most countries in the world have agreed that this must be done when they arrest a citizen of another country. Texas Governor and presidential candidate George W. Bush refused to grant a stay of the execution, saying there was no new evidence that questioned the jury's verdict in the death of Inez Phillips, who Faulder was convicted of killing in 1977. \"Had Stan Faulder been a Texan in Iran or Serbia and he was not notified of his right to seek help from the U.S. consulate had he been detained, would the U.S.A. tolerate it? I don't think so,\" Ms. Gingera says. \"They are undermining international law by saying that Texas has to go ahead with what they believe to be right.\" Ms. Gingera has been working with the Faulder family since 1997 to try to get human rights groups interested in the case. She acknowledges that Americans fighting the death penalty are just a few small voices. But she adds: \"I think Stan's death will certainly be a loud voice. There are many people from around the world who responded to his case and that will not go unheard.\" Ms. Gingera says she was alarmed by comments from Alberta Reform Member of Parliament Cliff Breitkreuz, who wanted Texas officials to ignore the argument that Mr. Faulder's rights were violated when he wasn't told he could contact Canadian consular officials when he was charged with murder. \"It's frightening to see people like... Cliff Breitkreuz and various people in the province of Alberta or Canada who say it's OK to ignore a violation of international law, it's OK to ignore a violation of human rights....\" She says while Faulder's supporters struggled with their anger Thursday, the inmate himself was peaceful. \"Stan's peace had really spread to many people and his peace truly helped his friends and family around him to be filled with a sense of peace.\" In the last few days, Mr. Faulder's relatives had hoped for a stay of execution but they weren't overly optimistic, she says. \"They did know that this was something that could really happen.\" Canada does not execute prisoners."}]}, {"title": "Last Eclipse of the Millennium Arrives", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "For whom did the last solar eclipse of the millennium brighten the morning?", "id": "1999-W33-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "millions of people in Europe", "answer_start": 68}]}, {"question": "What causes a solar eclipse?", "id": "1999-W33-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the moon passes between the Earth and the sun", "answer_start": 376}]}, {"question": "Where did the path of the moon's shadow begin?", "id": "1999-W33-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "in the Atlantic", "answer_start": 507}]}, {"question": "What is a total eclipse?", "id": "1999-W33-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the moon totally blocks the sun", "answer_start": 775}]}, {"question": "How many times can an eclipse occur in one year?", "id": "1999-W33-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "seven", "answer_start": 635}]}, {"question": "Why was this eclipse special?", "id": "1999-W33-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "it was a total eclipse", "answer_start": 745}]}, {"question": "How long do total eclipses last?", "id": "1999-W33-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a few minutes", "answer_start": 456}]}, {"question": "If an astronomer observed every total solar eclipse for twenty-five years, how much total eclipse time would he actually watch?", "id": "1999-W33-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "only about an hour of total eclipses", "answer_start": 954}]}, {"question": "Where could a partial eclipse be seen?", "id": "1999-W33-3-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Eastern Canada", "answer_start": 1141}]}, {"question": "What is a partial eclipse?", "id": "1999-W33-3-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the moon covers part, but not all of the sun", "answer_start": 1078}]}], "context": "The last solar eclipse of the millennium brightened the morning for millions of people in Europe on Wednesday.

The path of the moon's shadow began in the Atlantic, and crossed central Europe, Turkey, Iran and India. The maximum number of eclipses there can be in one year is seven. The minimum number of eclipses there can be in one year is two. What made this eclipse special is that it was a total eclipse, where the moon totally blocks the sun.

Last Thursday CBC4Kids explained why Saskatchewan Judge A. R. Rothery would not allow Tyrell to refuse cancer treatment. Justice Rothery said that it was in Tyrell's best interest to continue with chemotherapy even if he and his family were opposed. Tyrell was examined by doctors in Saskatoon on Friday. They were getting ready to follow the judge's orders and continue treating Tyrell. Instead the doctors discovered that cancer has spread from Tyrell's leg into his lungs. It has all but ended his chance of recovery. \"Tyrell's legal battles are over. The matter is most certainly in the hands of God, if it ever were in the hands of mortals,\" the Duecks' lawyer Owe Girths told a stunned crowd of supporters on Sunday. Doctors have told Tyrell they can do nothing more for him. He spent a quiet weekend at home as his family considered what to do now. \"He is suffering with some pain in his knee. The doctors have given him some pain control for that but he maintains the quiet confidence in his God that he has had since the beginning of this thing,\" Mr. Girths said. Tyrell first discovered a lump on his leg around his birthday, October 1, after he slipped in the shower. Bone cancer was diagnosed. He and his family fought to avoid standard cancer therapy, consisting of chemotherapy and at least the partial amputation of his leg. Chemotherapy consists of putting various chemicals into the body to destroy the cancer. The Dueck family are fundamentalist Christians and wanted to send the boy to Mexico for alternative treatment, which would include herbs and large doses of vitamins, and rely on the power of prayer. Saskatchewan's Social Services Department went to court twice to force the boy to submit to traditional treatment. Last week, a judge ordered Tyrell to resume treatment but the family planned to appeal. But none of that matters with the new diagnosis. Saskatchewan Social Services was to go to court this week to lift all the orders involving the boy's treatment. The boy's doctor has said only 10 per cent of patients survive with his form of cancer, a rare osteosarcoma, once it has moved into the lungs. Mr. Griffiths said Tyrell's parents Tim and Yvonne no longer harbour anger about being dragged through the courts while their son's illness worsened. \"There was perhaps momentary resentment but there is no longer any resentment on their part. They believe that this has all unfolded as God would have it unfold,\" says Mr. Griffiths. Other family members who heard yesterday's announcement weren't so sure. \"I think Tyrell would not be in the situation he is today if Social Services had not stepped in two months ago,\" said Kevin Hildebrandt, Tyrell's uncle."}]}, {"title": "Canadian Basketball Superstar", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What team did Babe play for?", "id": "1999-W03-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Edmonton Grads", "answer_start": 392}]}, {"question": "What position did Babe play?", "id": "1999-W03-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "forward", "answer_start": 1247}]}, {"question": "How tall was Babe?", "id": "1999-W03-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "5 feet, 2 inches", "answer_start": 1274}]}, {"question": "How much was Babe paid to play basketball?", "id": "1999-W03-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "never made a cent", "answer_start": 332}]}, {"question": "How many games did the Edmonton Grads win?", "id": "1999-W03-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "502", "answer_start": 1026}]}, {"question": "When did Babe play for \"the finest basketball team that ever stepped out on a floor\"?", "id": "1999-W03-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "from 1929 to 1937", "answer_start": 1217}]}, {"question": "Why did Babe stop playing basketball?", "id": "1999-W03-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "she got married", "answer_start": 217}]}, {"question": "Who was Babe's husband?", "id": "1999-W03-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Ian MacLean", "answer_start": 1383}]}, {"question": "Where did Babe's daughter find scrapbooks?", "id": "1999-W03-5-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "in the family's basement", "answer_start": 1639}]}], "context": "The world lost a basketball hero this week -- and we're not talking about Michael Jordan.

None of the members of the team expected to do as well as they did.  They were just a group of young women from the same school who liked to play basketball. Their coach was  teacher J. Percy Page, who later became the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta.  Their home base was  McDougall Commercial High School in Edmonton.   For 25 years -- from 1915 to 1940 -- they brought great honour to Canada and their home city , Edmonton. When they finally retired, the Grads had 108 championships to their credit. They won at all levels--local, regional, national, international and world.   Of the 522 games they played they won 502!

If the river does overflow, thousands of people would have to leave their homes and hundreds of square kilometres of farmland would be under water. Early settlers recognized the potential of the fertile soils along the Fraser for growing food. Busy harbours and towns grew nearby because of easy access to inland and marine transportation routes. This intensely used river is home to five deep-sea port facilities, a ferry terminal, several fishing boat basins and numerous marinas and floating homes. Over 200 companies, including several large woodand fish processing facilities operate on or near the Fraser. It also accommodates the largest log booming grounds in the world. The Fraser River is the largest river in British Columbia, over 1378 kilometres. long. Its headwaters are at Mount Robson in Jasper National Park. The drainage of the entire river basin (watershed) is nearly one quarter of a million square kilometers -- larger than the area of Great Britain. The flood of 1948, the last major flood in the Lower British Columbia Mainland, flooded the area with almost 8 metres of water, just 80 kilometres from Vancouver. The 1948 flood claimed 10 lives, destroyed or damaged 2,300 homes and caused $20 million in damage -- about $140 million in current dollars. Total water flows in the Fraser River this spring are predicted to reach 94 per cent of 1948 flood levels. Although some dikes have been improved, the potential for disaster lingers if further prevention measures aren't taken, provincial officials said yesterday. The worst flood in the area's history was in 1894, when water levels reached 7.92 metres. A federal-provincial Fraser River flood-control program has rebuilt about 250 kilometres of dikes to withhold water levels as high as those in the 1894 flood. But officials say an estimated 150 kilometres of dikes in the Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley could not hold back that much water. Should high-water levels persist for abut two weeks, the dikes would be at serious risk of becoming saturated and breaching (breaking), or allowing seepage to escape through the soil and bubble up around homes and buildings. \"This can be quite dangerous if not controlled,\" says Environment Ministry spokesman Neil Peters. \"There is always the possibility the dike could fail.\" Ultimately, the water levels depend on the weather. If the snow melts gradually, there would probably be high, but safe, water levels. A very rapid melt could result in major flooding. \"The worst-case scenario is a month of scorching weather,\" Peters said. \"We would approach 1948 or 1894 levels.\" River levels are unlikely to peak before mid-May at earliest, and the peak flows might not occur until late June. Even if 1894 river levels aren't reached this spring, it's just a matter of time before they are, Peters says. \"We know this flood will occur sooner or later.\""}]}, {"title": "Manitoba's No Kiss Zone", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why could students at Sisler High School be sent home or suspended for kissing?", "id": "2000-W06-4-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "if a friendly peck gets too passionate", "answer_start": 98}]}, {"question": "How are students at Sisler expected to treat each other, according to vice-principal Mike Kachmar?", "id": "2000-W06-4-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "with courtesy and respect", "answer_start": 367}]}, {"question": "How did Kachmar describe school?", "id": "2000-W06-4-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "as \"a place of business\"", "answer_start": 466}]}, {"question": "Why did Kachmar say he announced the ban on kissing?", "id": "2000-W06-4-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "he received complaints about a few students whose intense kissing was making others uncomfortable", "answer_start": 607}]}, {"question": "How far back in Western civilization are there references to kissing?", "id": "2000-W06-4-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "back to the Old Testament", "answer_start": 1111}]}, {"question": "Who said he has never witnessed a problem in Sisler's hallways?", "id": "2000-W06-4-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Jeffrey Besyk", "answer_start": 694}]}, {"question": "Where was kissing rarely practiced until the 20th century?", "id": "2000-W06-4-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "East Asia", "answer_start": 1536}]}, {"question": "When were medieval knights kissed?", "id": "2000-W06-4-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "after being knighted", "answer_start": 1365}]}, {"question": "What is the \"holy kiss\" still a part of?", "id": "2000-W06-4-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Roman Catholic rituals", "answer_start": 1258}]}], "context": "Students who lock lips in the hallways of Winnipeg's Sisler High School have been warned: if that friendly peck gets too passionate, they couldbe sent home or even suspended.

Medieval knights were kissed after being knighted, and the custom of kissing the bride remains almost universal in Western marriage ceremonies.

But it now looks like Alexi Yashin was not really being honest. It seems he actually changed his mind because federal Auditor General Denis Desautels told him he was trying to break the law. Mr. Yashin originally announced he was a lover of the arts. He said that as a well paid hockey player he wanted to help the National Arts Centre put on new performances. But behind the scenes his plan was not to give the Arts Centre one million dollars. Instead, in a secret agreement, the National Arts Centre would have hired Mr. Yashin's parents at $85,000 a year. They would have been paid out of Alexi Yashin's yearly $200,000 donation. What's more, his parents would not have to actually work. This was a way for Alexi Yashin to give money to his parents while illegally saving thousands of dollars in taxes. As well, a lawyer working for Mr. Yashin was to get $15,000 out of the remaining $115,000. So in fact the million dollar donation would really only be half of that. It would have been a great public relations victory. Mr. Yashin would look like he was being very generous. But behind the scenes he was really much less so. Yesterday evening the Ottawa Senators were playing in Boston. After the game reporters went to the locker room to ask Alexi Yashin what was going on. But he refused to talk to reporters about his \"personal reasons\" for cancelling his donation. He said simply that \"I know I didn't do anything illegal. I know I didn't do anything wrong. I can't control what they say. It's a free country.\" He also said he wanted to focus on hockey and nothing else. The other players and coach of the Ottawa Senators would not comment either. They said it was Alexi's personal affair and not important to them. Many Ottawa-area hockey fans are deeply disappointed with what is going on. \"People here are puzzled. They feel let down,\" says Rick Soweita, who owns a sports bar. \"He benefited from the publicity and now he's got to own up.\""}]}, {"title": "The War in Yugoslavia is Officially Over", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who is the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)?", "id": "1999-W26-1-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a group of Yugoslavians of Albanian heritage who were fighting against the Yugoslavian army", "answer_start": 255}]}, {"question": "As part of the peace deal with the KLA, what have KLA members agreed to do?", "id": "1999-W26-1-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "hand over their large weapons to NATO forces and stop wearing military uniforms", "answer_start": 384}]}, {"question": "Where are ethnic Albanian refugees living?", "id": "1999-W26-1-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "refugee camps and countries around the world", "answer_start": 759}]}, {"question": "When did the G8 meet to come up with a plan to rebuild the war-torn region of Yugoslavia?", "id": "1999-W26-1-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "over the weekend", "answer_start": 155}]}, {"question": "How much could it cost to rebuild from the damage caused by NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia?", "id": "1999-W26-1-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "more than a hundred billion dollars", "answer_start": 1418}]}, {"question": "Why is a democratic society in Kosovo essential, according to Lloyd Axworthy?", "id": "1999-W26-1-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "that's the only way that you're going to bring ultimate peace, stability and reconstruction to the area", "answer_start": 2168}]}], "context": "Now that the Yugoslavian army has completely withdrawn from the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo, NATO's military campaign in Yugoslavia is officially over. Over the weekend, NATO authorities also reached a peace deal with the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), a group of Yugoslavians of Albanian heritage who were fighting against the Yugoslavian army. The deal says that KLA members will hand over their large weapons to NATO forces and stop wearing military uniforms. Now the war-torn region in eastern Europe is faced with the enormous task of rebuilding and overcoming the ethnic hatred that started the conflict. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians are still in refugee camps in the countries surrounding Yugoslavia. Thousands of others are refugees in countries around the world, including Canada. These people must now make the decision if - or when - they will go home. Thousands of Yugolsavians of Serbian heritage have now been chased from Kosovo by the people of Albanian heritage who have returned. One of the major questions is this: what will happen to those Serbs who decide to remain in Kosovo? Will Albanians and Serbs be able to live together in peace? The NATO bombing of Yugoslavia destroyed hundreds of roads, bridges, factories, oil refineries, electric generating plants and office buildings. Many thousands of people were killed - both by the NATO bombs and by Serbian soldiers. It could cost more than a hundred billion dollars to rebuild what NATO destroyed in Yugoslavia. Over the weekend the leaders of the world's eight leading industrialized countries, known as the Group of Eight or the G8, met in Cologne, Germany. The G8 countries are: Germany, The United States, Canada, Japan, Russia, France, Britain, and Italy. At the top of the agenda was coming up with a plan to rebuild the region and make sure that a lasting peace can be maintained. Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs says the peace process will make an effort to \"democratize\" Kosovo, aiming for eventual elections. A civilian administration will likely look after this end of business. \"I don't think there's any doubt that we want to see a democratic society there -- that's the only way that you're going to bring ultimate peace, stability and reconstruction to the area,\" says Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy. \"I think that those processes are under way already in Serbia. I think that you'll be seeing a new political dynamic emerging in that region.\" Over the next few days, weeks and months, the world will also be watching to see what happens with Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic, who is still in power. One thing appears certain -- Milosevic will not be leaving Yugoslavia. He has been charged with war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal. The Tribunal is trying to arrest people who have broken international humanitarian law. If Mr. Milosevic tries to leave Yugoslavia he could be arrested and taken to court in The Hague, The Netherlands, where the court is located. And there he would be put on trial. If he was found guilty he could spend many, many years in jail."}]}, {"title": "Earthquake Shakes Turkey", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where did the centre of the earthquake hit?", "id": "1999-W34-4-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Izmit", "answer_start": 120}]}, {"question": "What is the capital of Turkey?", "id": "1999-W34-4-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Istanbul", "answer_start": 152}]}, {"question": "When did the earthquake hit?", "id": "1999-W34-4-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "around 3 o'clock in the morning", "answer_start": 335}]}, {"question": "Who spent hours digging through the rubble?", "id": "1999-W34-4-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "rescue workers", "answer_start": 400}]}, {"question": "About how many people were reportedly injured by the earthquake?", "id": "1999-W34-4-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "at least 21,000", "answer_start": 593}]}, {"question": "Why are earthquake victims being treated on the streets?", "id": "1999-W34-4-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Turkish hospitals are overcrowded", "answer_start": 653}]}, {"question": "What was the magnitude of the earthquake, according to the National Earthquake Information Centre in Colorado?", "id": "1999-W34-4-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "7.8", "answer_start": 834}]}, {"question": "What does earthquake magnitude measure?", "id": "1999-W34-4-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the amount of energy released by an earthquake", "answer_start": 927}]}, {"question": "What are aftershocks?", "id": "1999-W34-4-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "vibrations that follow an earthquake", "answer_start": 1076}]}, {"question": "What are Canada's disaster assistance troops trained in?", "id": "1999-W34-4-11", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "communication and providing medical assistance", "answer_start": 1493}]}], "context": "An powerful earthquake shook a densely populated part of western Turkey early Tuesday.

The area has a population of about one million. The earthquake hit at about 3 o'clock in the morning, while many people were still sleeping. Rescue workers spent hours digging through the rubble, frantically trying to save people trapped under concrete and metal. The earthquake has reportedly killed more than 6,000 people, and left at least 21,000 injured. Because of the number of injuries, Turkish hospitals are overcrowded, and can't take anymore patients. As a result, many of the earthquake victims were being treated on the streets. The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.8, according to the National Earthquake Information Centre in Colorado. Magnitude measures the amount of energy released by an earthquake. An observatory in Istanbul said more than 250 aftershocks followed the first tremor. Aftershocks are vibrations that follow an earthquake. Officials have warned people not to return to buildings with even some sign of structural damage, for fear there may be more collapses. Despite the much higher death toll, Tuesday's earthquake wasn't quite as powerful as a 1906 earthquake in San Francisco which had a magnitude of 7.9.

The 37-year-old Calgary native who now lives in Tempe, Arizona, is part owner of the NHL s Edmonton Oilers. He has a company that makes action figures, and says the timing of his announcement was tied to the yearly Toy Fair in New York. Mr. McFarlane, who paid $3,005,000 U.S. for home run ball no. 70, had not seen the ball until Monday, when he came to New York fresh from a stay at the Baltimore Orioles  fantasy camp in Florida. He now owns 9 historic baseballs. Yesterday they were displayed in front of him in nine cases atop nine columns - white and  grey for No. 70, black for the others - with four burgundy velvet ropes separating them from the crowd and five men in blue security uniforms standing to the side. He says he would like to allow the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York to show McGwire s 70th home run ball at times. He would make it available to charities to raise money, and would let individual major league teams display it. And what would he like in return? \"I d like to be able to take 20 swings in every major league ball park,\" he says. Mr. McFarlane, who owns autographs from Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, says purchasing the ball was cheaper than buying a sports team. In all, McFarlane bought nine home run balls hit by McGwire and Sammy Sosa, including McGwires, 63rd, 67th, 68th and 69th, and Sosa s 33rd (his record 20th in June), 61st and 66th. Mr. McFarlane bought the ball at auction January 12, paying more than $3 million Canadian to Philip Ozersky. The research scientist caught the ball September 27 at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri. Sammy Sosa s final home run of the season, No. 66, cost Mr. McFarlane about $250,000 Canadian.  All the  others he bought at the auction cost under $20,000 apiece. \"I blew my life savings on this,\" McFarlane says. \"I m not like the American billionaire Donald Trump. I don t have a lot of cash.\" The group of balls will be called The McFarlane Collection. \"Given that I name all my corporations after myself, I ll name it after myself,\" he said. \"Better than  The Guy Who Has More Money Than Brains Collection.  \" Source: The Canadian Press, CBC News"}]}, {"title": "A Looming Battle in Kosovo", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What do the nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization want to stop the Yugoslavians from doing?", "id": "1999-W13-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "invading neighbouring Kosovo", "answer_start": 605}]}, {"question": "What are the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo pushing for?", "id": "1999-W13-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "independence from Serbia", "answer_start": 823}]}, {"question": "How old are the roots of the conflict between Kosovo and Serbia?", "id": "1999-W13-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "hundreds and hundreds of years", "answer_start": 1332}]}, {"question": "When did the Serbs lose a key battle against the forces of the invading Ottoman Empire in Kosovo?", "id": "1999-W13-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1389", "answer_start": 1367}]}, {"question": "Where is the capital of Kosovo?", "id": "1999-W13-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Pristina", "answer_start": 57}]}, {"question": "Who is Slobodan Milosevic?", "id": "1999-W13-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Yugoslav President", "answer_start": 2416}]}, {"question": "How has Milosevic described the problems in Kosovo?", "id": "1999-W13-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "as an internal Yugoslav matter", "answer_start": 2573}]}, {"question": "What does Milosevic refuse to do?", "id": "1999-W13-3-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "he refuses to allow any outside force into Kosovo to monitor any peace agreement", "answer_start": 2602}]}, {"question": "What do Yugoslav officials feel they can do in a war against NATO?", "id": "1999-W13-3-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "inflict serious damage", "answer_start": 2310}]}, {"question": "How many Canadian Forces personnel are based in Aviano, Italy?", "id": "1999-W13-3-11", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "about 130", "answer_start": 2747}]}], "context": "Air-raid warning sirens sounded in the Kosovo capital of Pristina this morning. Yugoslavia is bracing for air strikes by NATO forces. Reporters say the siren lasted about 90 seconds. There was a brief pause before the siren sounded again. Yugoslav authorities have declared a state of emergency. They are getting ready for war. They've shut down the country's main independent radio station and they're preparing shelters for the civilian population. This is happening because the coalition of countries that are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organizatoin (NATO) want to stop the Yugoslavians from invading the neighbouring region of Kosovo. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which is one of the republics that make up Yugoslavia. Ninety per cent of Kosovo's population are ethnic Albanians, who have been pushing for independence from Serbia. Brigadier-General Michel Maisonneuve is the senior Canadian Forces officer who has been serving with NATO. He adds that \"Kosovo is a beautiful part of Yugoslavia. It is relatively flat, with mountains surrounding it, as well as a spine that runs up the middle. The province is in large majority ethnic Albanian, with many other minorities, including Serbs, gypsies, Turks, etc. The people are hospitable and hardy.\" The conflict that is being played out today has roots that go back hundreds and hundreds of years. In 1389, Serbs lost a key battle against the forces of the invading Ottoman Empire on the fields of Kosovo. The defeat marks the beginning of the end of Serbia's Medieval Empire. Kosovo became part of the Ottoman Empire. In the following centuries that battle become the key event in Serbian and Albanian national history. Over the last decade there have been many attempts at a peaceful settlement. Representatives of the NATO countries have tried to negotiate with the government of Yugoslavia. Those negotions failed earlier this week. NATO says that bombing Yugoslavia is the only way to get them to stop their assault on Kosovo. The question is no longer if, but when, NATO will begin bombing. NATO Secretary General Javier Solana assured Yugoslovia's neighbours today that the alliance would protect them in the event of attacks by Yugoslavia. Yugoslav officials say they might not be able to win a war against NATO, but they feel they can inflict serious damage. NATO military planners aren't taking the threats lightly. Few people believe that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is ready to give in. He opposes outside interference in Kosovo. The Yugoslav leader insists the problems in Kosovo are an internal Yugoslav matter. He refuses to allow any outside force into Kosovo to monitor any peace agreement. If NATO strikes proceed, Canadians will be involved.

Premier Harris says it was the hardest-fought campaign in recent memory. Yesterday the Conservatives won 59 seats in the Ontario legislature. That means representatives of their party won in 59 \"ridings\" -- small political regions across the province. The Liberals led by Dalton McGuinty got 35 seats, and the New Democratic Party under leader Howard Hampton took nine seats. In Ontario's new 103-seat legislature, the Tories needed 52 seats for a majority government -- a government where they control more than half the seats. They got 8 more than that. A majority government makes it much easier for the ruling party to make decisions, because they get more than half of the votes on any issue. The Premier says he will now push ahead with following through on his campaign promises. They included things like cutting taxes, testing teachers, and cracking down on panhandlers and squeegee kids. It's the first time in 32 years that any party has won two majority governments in a row in Ontario. \"Four years ago you sent me to do a job, you placed your faith in our team, in our plan, and we have done our very best to implement that plan and keep your faith,\" Premier Harris told cheering supporters in North Bay. \"There is a new pride in Ontario. Our economy is back on track... faith in our future has been restored.\" Premier Harris was attacked during the campaign as leading a mean-spirited government, and for being a man who refused to compromise. During the campaign, he was hounded by protesters at every appearance. Election day began with a controversy, as polls did not open on time in several ridings. Several returning officers (the people in charge of a polling station) called in sick.

The Mars Polar Lander was on a mission to Mars to study its atmosphere and search for water, something that could help scientists determine whether life ever existed on Mars. Polar Lander was to have touched down December 3 for a 90-day mission. It was to land near Mars' south pole. The lander was last heard from minutes before beginning its descent. The last effort to communicate with the three-legged lander ended with frustration at 8 a.m Monday. \"We didn't see anything,\" said Richard Cook, the spacecraft's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The failed mission to the Red Planet cost the American government more than $200 million dollars. Now, space agency scientists and engineers will try to find out what could have gone wrong. They do not want to make the same mistakes in the next mission. Controllers have been testing dozens of different scenarios to try and explain what might have happened to the lander. Nobody knows exactly what happened to the lander, but there are several theories. The Mars Polar Lander could have touched down on the side of a canyon and toppled over. Some people think the lander could have exploded before entering the atmosphere. Others say its radio systems might have failed, or that the lander could have sunk into Martian dust. NASA sent a spacecraft called the Mars Global Surveyor to take high-resolution images of the landing site to search for signs of the lander. NASA hoped the orbiter would spot the lander's parachute or shadow. But so far attempts to capture a picture of the lander's parachute have been unsuccessful. Another lander and orbiter are scheduled to launch next year, but at least part of the mission is now in doubt. \"The orbiter for sure will happen. There's no issue there,\" Mr. Cook says. \"The lander they're still talking about.\" The Polar Lander Spacecraft was 1.06 metres tall by 3.6 metres wide.

Later today Wayne Gretzky will be competing again. At four o'clock this afternoon, the player hockey fans say is probably the best the game has ever known, and that some people say is the greatest professional athlete ever will be... bowling. The revelation came late in yesterday's news conference. In front of hundreds of reporters from all over North America and Europe Wayne Gretzky announced that he was going to hit the 10-pin bowling lanes in New York City. \"I'm going to spend the afternoon with my teammates - a bowling party and I'm looking forward to it, I'm going to enjoy. I've only bowled in Canada and it's five pin, they tell me here its 10 pin. I don't know if I can lift the ball. \" Yesterday was an emotional day for Gretzky fans. With tears and typical grace, Wayne Gretzky skated away from professional hockey. It's the second time in three months that one of the world's premier athletes has chosen to retire. \"It was a tough game for me today,\" Mr. Gretzky said of his farewell from the sport he dominated for two decades. \"I wanted it to be a celebration. \"You know, this is not a passing on,\" he added, his eyes watery. \"This is a moving on.\" It was a moving scene as the sport's greatest player said goodbye. The National Hockey League also retired No. 99, which commissioner Gary Bettman announced would never be worn in the league again. Gretzky has been the National Hockey League's Michael Jordan -- an almost mythical figure that fans of all teams admired and packed arenas to see. Perhaps fittingly, Jordan himself appeared in a second-period video, telling Gretzky, \"Your golf game is not going to get better, so don't think that will help. Relax and enjoy being a dad.\" \"It's always too soon when you see a great player retire,\" said Mario Lemieux, the retired Pittsburgh Penguins centre. \"It's going to be very difficult for the National Hockey League to lose the best hockey player that ever played, and he's been such a great ambassador for the game for 20 years.\" In front of Lemieux sat Mark Messier - who played with Mr. Gretzky for the Edmonton Oilers - and many other former teammates and opponents who admired \"The Great One\". When the game was over (the Penguins won 2-1) Gretzky smiled through tears during four final laps of Madison Square Garden. He skated slowly enough for plenty of souvenir photos to be taken of the player who holds or shares 61 NHL records. Whenever he noticed a youngster's extended hand from the crowd, he touched it. He even played to the fans, donning a blue Yankees hat, then a red Rangers beret. Then, almost as suddenly as word had come last week that he was retiring, Number 99 was gone. \"I'm devastated I will no longer be a hockey player,\" said Wayne Gretzky, 38, his eyes still red, said more than an hour after his final skate. \"I will miss every part of the game, because I loved every part of the game. \"But I've made the right decision.\" As he left the arena, Wayne's father and mother told him they were proud of him."}]}, {"title": "Evacuation in Northern Saskatchewan", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How many people live in La Ronge?", "id": "1999-W22-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "2,800", "answer_start": 472}]}, {"question": "Who is the mayor of La Ronge?", "id": "1999-W22-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Joe Hordyski", "answer_start": 2976}]}, {"question": "Why did Gary Vettree's house not burn down?", "id": "1999-W22-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "he soaked it with water", "answer_start": 1220}]}, {"question": "How high was the fire in the industrial area of town?", "id": "1999-W22-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "six metres above the trees", "answer_start": 1910}]}, {"question": "Where were the evacuees taken when the fire threatened their homes?", "id": "1999-W22-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the local health clinic and a hockey arena", "answer_start": 2182}]}, {"question": "When were the evacuees able to go back to their homes?", "id": "1999-W22-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "last night", "answer_start": 217}]}], "context": "More than half the residents of the northern Saskatchewan community of La Ronge were evacuated briefly yesterday as a forest fire scorched its outskirts.

And the evacuees remained on alert, ready to run again on a moment's notice if hot spots flared up. La Ronge is a community of 2,800 people located 300 kilometres north of Saskatoon. It is located on lac La Ronge. Residents \"have to go back with the understanding that they could be called out at any moment,\" says RCMP Cpl. Gary MacDonald. Although the evacuees were told they could spend the night in the local arena, virtually all the townspeople chose to sleep in their own beds. Volunteer firefighters were to remain on patrol all night, ready to run door-to-door and give the alert if winds picked up and sparked a new blaze. Trees were still burning at Gary Vettree's in Eagle Point, which was directly in the path of a fast-moving fire. His was one of two homes still standing; seven houses just down the road burned to the ground. Vettree saved his house by soaking it with water. \"Scary, really scary,\" he says of the blaze, \"Smoke, fire, animals running all over, rabbits, birds.\" After days of dry winds and electrical storms - there have been 3,000 lightning strikes over the last couple days - the fire began in the bush southwest of town at about noon Thursday. Strong winds pushed it northeast and by 1 p.m., when the fire grew dangerously close to a bulk fuel station, RCMP were running from door to door asking people to leave. \"People were crying,\" says one resident, who loaded up his photo albums and hooked his prized boat to his car before leaving his home with his wife. \"At that point the fire was about a quarter-mile away.\" The fire shot six metres above the trees as it roared through the industrial area of town. Highway 2 was closed. \"I watched the fire, when it was just feet away from an industrial shop, burn the end of the building,\" said the man, who didn't want his name used. Evacuees were housed in the local health clinic and a hockey arena. \"In some places it was so bad you could hardly see,\" says restaurant worker Angela Krienke. Some evacuees with respiratory problems received treatment. There are 459 firefighters fighting the fires in Northern Saskatchewan. Working or on standby for fire suppression activities are: 24 helicopters, 12 water bomber aircraft, 8 bulldozers and 1 swamp tractor. Early damage estimates include a shop burned out in the industrial area. Several mobile homes were destroyed, as were four large buildings and four cabins at a local lakeside resort. No injuries were reported. \"It's amazing that so much vegetation on the perimeter of our community was totally destroyed and we were very fortunate that so little property was destroyed,\" says La Ronge Mayor Joe Hordyski. \"It's just a miracle.\" In northern Alberta, meanwhile, a forest fire just north of Fort McMurray threatened the region's power supply as it burned out of control Thursday. There are a number of fires burning near Fort McMurray, three out of control. None were threatening the town.

Try 40,000 years, to be precise. New research suggests that's how long people have inhabited the Yukon. That is tens of thousands of years earlier than originally thought. The previously accepted theory about the populating of North America was that the first inhabitants crossed a land bridge from Asia into what is now Alaska roughly 10,000 to 11,000 years ago, after the last Ice Age. Since the 1960s, scientists have pointed to \"Clovis points\" - 10,000 to 11,000-year-old stone tools found throughout much of unglaciated North America. But recently, scientists have suggested that the region known as Eastern Beringia, now in the eastern Yukon, could have been inhabited at least as far back as 25,000 years ago. Some researchers think habitation of the Americas dates back even further. \"My view is that there is no question that there were people in Eastern Beringia 40,000 years ago, and this view has to be taken into serious consideration if you want to discuss the peopling of the New World,\" says Jacques Cinq-Mars, an archeologist at the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Ottawa. At that time, during an ice age, much of North America sat under a kilometre-thick slab of glacial ice. But the Beringia area, which stretched from Siberia across Alaska and Yukon and into the Northwest Territories, remained ice-free. The latest evidence supporting the earlier dates was found in the Bluefish Caves, on the Bluefish River about 50 kilometres southeast of Old Crow. Archeologists found in the caves a mammoth bone that was probably flaked and shaped by human hands roughly 23,500 years ago. The caves also contained hundreds of bones from at least 18 species of migratory birds. The bones are anywhere from 10,000 to 25,000 years old. Many of the bird bones also show human-made cut marks. Mr. Cinq-Mars believes the caves were likely used by hunters over a period of roughly 15,000 years. The Bluefish Caves were re-discovered by Mr. Cinq-Mars in 1975. He led a research team that excavated the caves 1978 and 1987. The team's findings are showcased at the Beringia Interpretive Centre on the Alaska Highway. Heather Pringle is the author of In Search of Ancient North America, part of which is about the Bluefish Caves in northern Yukon. She says that \"most people still think of archeologists as wild guys in jungles looking for priceless artifacts to go in a museum. It seems to me archeology is much more about uncovering the lives of ancient people.\""}]}, {"title": "Smart Kids Survive Storm", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where did the Kolla boys get lost?", "id": "1999-W07-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": " a ski resort", "answer_start": 27}]}, {"question": "Who is the youngest brother?", "id": "1999-W07-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "A.J.

Earlier this week they described how they did it. \"We had faith that we could pull through it and we kept our cool and didn't panic,\" said A.J. Kolla, who celebrated his 14th birthday on Tuesday, two days after he and his brother were caught out overnight at the Schweitzer Mountain Ski Resort in Sandpoint, Idaho. The ordeal began Saturday morning, when the boys took a wrong turn heading back to the resort chalet. The boys were skiing by themselves while their father attended a veterinary conference. The two kept heading downhill, but when they reached a riverbank around 4 p.m., they realized they were lost and decided to head back uphill to try to regain their way. \"When we were hiking back and it was starting to get dark, we realized 'Oh oh, we're going to be here for a while,'\" said A.J. Using their hands, the two dug into the snow hollow around the base of a tree, covered the floor with pine boughs and settled in for a long, cold night. \"We slept in shifts, 'cause it was very cold and we were very wet,\" said Michael, 15. The two conserved heat by crossing their arms over their chests and pressing up back-to-back. Wiggling their toes to keep out frostbite, they talked about getting home and eating. \"A.J. kept talking about a strudel that was left at the hotel,\" said Michael. \"I had a dream that we all of sudden stumbled across a fort or a hut, and it was warm and we had tons of food.\" Meanwhile, a blizzard outside the shelter was dumping 45 centimetres of snow and whipping it around with 110-kilometres-an-hour winds. The weather was so bad that the search parties were called in and the search called off. Shortly after 6 a.m., there was enough light for the boys to start hiking back again. But after four hours of post-holing uphill through snow up to their waists, they were too tired to continue. They dug a cave into a snowbank, crossed Michael's skis out front in case a helicopter flew over, and went inside to rest. \"A.J. was lying there and shivering and I'd always be thinking, `It's a helicopter,'\" Michael said. After a rest, they set out again and soon came to the cross-country ski trail where they were found by a party of snowmobilers. They had no frostbite or hypothermia. \"The ski patrol helped us out, first aid, got some food, and that's about all,\" shrugged A.J. Father Michael Kolla was at the resort after a sleepless night when he got the word the boys were safe and sound. \"I was just ecstatic,\" he recalls. \"We were in a circle and jumping around and hugging each other.\" His wife Carol was on a plane flying to Sandpoint when a message came back from the pilot saying: \"Boys found. Under observation.\" \"Then we just had a great drive up to Schweitzer,\" she said, her voice shaking. \"We were so happy.\" The family credits winter camping tips from a friend for saving the boys' lives. Although they'd never slept out in one before, Michael and A.J. had built snow shelters many times in their backyard. \"They knew if they built these things they'd stay warm,\" said Carol. \"They helped my boys live.\" The boys soon figured they would have to stick together to survive. \"At the start when we were just lost, we were kind of snappy at each other, but by the end we were encouraging each other, saying `You can do it,' \" said Michael. \"When we were on the mountain I just thought that we've got to keep our heads on and keep ourselves together and encourage each other and that's what ending up happening.\" When will they hit the hill next? \"Soon as possible, I guess,\" said Michael."}]}, {"title": "Canadians Lend Kosovars a Hand", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where is Kosovo?", "id": "1999-W22-2-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the Balkans", "answer_start": 200}]}, {"question": "When did the NATO bombing start?", "id": "1999-W22-2-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "March 24, 1999", "answer_start": 1456}]}, {"question": "What will Thordis Gutnick do for the refugees?", "id": "1999-W22-2-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "teach English", "answer_start": 1178}]}, {"question": "How many Kosovars are eligible for Canada's family reunification program?", "id": "1999-W22-2-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "2,000", "answer_start": 1778}]}, {"question": "Why is the Kosovo leadership concerned about taking refugees so far from home?", "id": "1999-W22-2-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "many will not return", "answer_start": 2527}]}, {"question": "Who is the attorney general of British Columbia?", "id": "1999-W22-2-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Ujal Dosnajh", "answer_start": 468}]}], "context": "Residents of British Columbia's Lower Mainland seem to be freer with their cash than they are with their time.

Spokesperson Adrienne Bakker says the Red Cross Appeal has received an average of $20,000 a week. But B.C.'s attorney general says few people have come forward to help the Kosovo refugees who will soon arrive in British Columbia. Ujal Dosnajh stresses there is no cost, and no requirement to put refugees in homes. Mr. Dosanjh says he is looking for more than 200 sponsors who can provide emotional and psychological support. Church groups, schools, and businesses can offer their assistance to the government. \"Kosovars\" is the term generally used for people of Albanian ethnic heritage who live in the southern Yugolsavian province of Kosovo. In Calgary, Alberta, for example, the Unitarian Church is sponsoring a group of refugees. This means everything from finding clothes and shelter to finding schools for the children and jobs for their parents. One member of the church, Thordis Gutnick, will be spending the next couple of months teaching English to the refugees. She is looking forward to it as she says it will allow her to show them what a wonderful country Canada can be. She is also looking forward to discussing the NATO bombing with them. Ms. Gutnick has been opposed to the bombing since it began on March 24. She wants to hear the opinions of the refugees and try and better understand what is happening in Yugoslavia. So far nearly 5,000 Kosovo refugees have come to Canada. But they won't be the last displaced Kosovars headed here. More refugees will continue to arrive under Canada's family reunification plan. \"Some 2,000 people have been identified as potentially eligible for that program. Of those, 400 have already arrived,\" says Raphael Girard, Canada's ambassador to Yugoslavia. Canada has set no limit for the number of refugees eligible for the family reunification plan. When the airlift ends Wednesday, Canada will have fulfilled its pledge to accept 5,000 refugees. Officials say Ottawa won't take in more unless requested by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Out of 135,000 spaces for refugees offered by the international community, only 55,000 have been transported out of the region in the last month. The ambassador said that there is anxiety among the Kosovar leadership that by taking refugees so far afield \"many of these people will not return and in so doing Yugoslavia President Slobodan Milosevic's agenda (of getting rid of ethnic Albanians living in the southern Yugoslavian province of Kosovo) will be achieved.\" In total, 1.6 million people have fled Kosovo as Yugoslavian Serb forces purge the province of ethnic Albanians.

Today he is in a Mexican hotel, waiting to find out when he will finally be allowed to fly back to Montreal. Pascal, who is 20, was released yesterday from the Chiapas state penitentiary of Cerro Hueco -- where he had staged a hunger strike to protest his arrest last September 28th. He was set free after relatives paid a $1,200 fine. Last fall Mexican prosecutors charged Pascal with stealing small clay figurines from the Palenque ruins. He was put in jail in January. A local judge found Hudon guilty of the theft charges. Under Mexican law, all pre-Hispanic artifacts are considered national treasures. \"He's very happy because he's returning to his country,\" his lawyer, Alphonso Herrera Gonzalez, said. \"He called me from a pay phone to say he was finally free,\" his mother, Jocelyne Dion, told the french language newspaper Le Journal de Montreal. \"He was shouting with joy.\" For the Mexican authorities, their fight to prevent the looting of Mexico's vast stash of historical treasures is far from resolved. \"Looting and the illegal export of archeological goods is fairly prevalent,\" says Joaquin Garcia, chairman of Mexico's archeology council. Mexico has about 200,000 archeological sites, and only about 150 are monitored constantly and open to the public, he said. \"It's quite difficult to take care of them. We depend much on the people who live near the sites.\" Although Mexico has had laws to prevent looting since the middle of the 19th century, Mexicans have become increasingly alarmed lately about losing their national heritage to looters, and have started to apply their laws with greater vigilance. Mr. Hudon was a prime example of the new get-tough attitude. The former college student was found carrying eight pieces of ceramics, which he said he found on a path in the bush near the Palenque historical site in southern Mexico. Mr. Hudon has said he had intended to hand over the pottery to authorities, but before he had a chance to do so, he was stopped by police. They searched him and charged him with illegally possessing artifacts. He was put in a federal prison in Tuxtla Gutierrez in Chiapas state in the south of Mexico at the beginning of January. At a trial in February, he was sentenced to a year in jail plus one month of labour, and told to pay $72,000 to the National Institute of History and Anthropology. His family and friends in Montreal protested, and Mr. Hudon went on a hunger strike. The Canadian embassy intervened, and Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy spoke publicly about the need to get the young man out of prison in Chiapas. Last month, Mr. Hudon appealed the case. He was allowed to give a new statement through a translator. The judge ruled that he was not legally obliged to pay $72,000 to the institute, and lowered the fine to $2,500. Artifacts, some dating back tens of thousands of years, are frequently stolen when sites are discovered by excavators or through small-scale looting, he said. There has been looting at only three major projects in the past 15 years -- projects run by foreign experts. All three were halted and many artifacts recovered. Small-scale looting, however, has landed between 40 and 50 people in jail every year. And Mr. Garcia is sure much theft goes undetected. Despite his serious troubles, Pascal has not lost the urge to travel. He told his mom that after he visits with his family back in Montreal, he wants to head out to British Columbia to work as a tree-planter.

They set off this week on foot and by camel on a grueling trek across the burning Arabian desert. When they were still in Canada, planning their trip, they expected they would feel lonely. But after two days into the 1,200 kilometre journey, the caravan has won celebrity status among the native Bedouin people and government officials of Oman. Some have excitedly tagged along, says expedition leader Jamie Clarke. Mr. Clarke is making the trek with his older brother Leigh and their friend Bruce Kirby. They have hired three  guides. They are now in the Omani city of Solalah on the Arabian Sea. The group was forced to return briefly to replace some broken equipment, notably camel saddles, 40 kilometres into the odyssey. The adventurers expect to travel for up to 55 days through the scorching heat and towering dunes of Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. They are attempting to become the first Westerners in more than 50 years to cross the Empty Quarter of Arabia, the world's largest sand desert. Mr. Clarke has adventure in his blood. He scaled Mount Everest in the Himalayas in 1997. Now he and his companions are following a famous route taken by British adventurer Sir Wilfred Thesiger in 1947. They are journeying through the harsh and mostly uninhabited desert wearing the clothes and eating the food that is traditional for the nomadic Bedouin people. \"It's quite an event here to have us crossing the desert in such a traditional fashion and in the footsteps of Thesiger,\" Mr. Clarke says. \"So, our team can be anywhere from our six normal members on up to quadruple that size at night when people walk into camp or walk along with us to cheer us on.\" The site of the expedition's camp Wednesday was the Ayoon pools, north of Solalah, where temperatures during the day rise to 45 degrees Celsius  and fall at night to as low as 3 degrees Celsius. The start of the trip was delayed because of technical problems with communications equipment for use in emergencies and because of stomach problems after Clarke had his first taste of the Bedouin delicacy of goat brains. \"When the Bedouin cook, they are accustomed to using all of the animal. Every edible piece of the creature is in the pot, among them are some of the unsavory stuff like brains,\" Mr. Clarke says. \"I'm keen to try everything and sometimes it just doesn't agree. A little nausea, throwing up and diarrhea shouldn't hold somebody back.\" Mr. Clarke and his companions met with Mr. Thesiger, who is now 88, in London, England on their way to the Middle East from Canada. Mr. Thesiger's book Arabian Sands told the story of his 1947 trek. Among Mr. Thesiger's words of advice for the trio was to take great care of the camels because their lives depend on the very stubborn animals as transportation for themselves and their provisions. \"I don't think we really understood the magnitude of that statement, which is so simple and obvious. Yet in the first two weeks of our training here and the first two days of our journey, it's incredible how powerful that statement is,\" Mr. Clarke says. From Solalah, the route will take the group through Saudi Arabia and the trek will finish in Abu Dhabi. Along the way the party must cross the Uruq al Shaiba range of mountainous dunes, pass by the quicksand of Umm al Samim (Mother of Poison) and hike across a 185-mile stretch that has no water supply."}]}, {"title": "NASA Refuses to Launch Canadian Satellite", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How can the satellite help farmers?", "id": "1999-W08-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "it can help forecast crop yields", "answer_start": 801}]}, {"question": "Why might the Canadian government have to get someone else beside NASA to launch the satellite for them?", "id": "1999-W08-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "NASA is refusing to send the Radarsat-2 satellite into the sky", "answer_start": 105}]}, {"question": "Who is concerned about Radarsat-2's powerful abilities?", "id": "1999-W08-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the United States", "answer_start": 169}]}, {"question": "Who is the director of strategic development for the Canadian Space Agency?", "id": "1999-W08-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Hugues Gilbert", "answer_start": 458}]}], "context": "A new Canadian radar satellite sees too much, too clearly, according to NASA, the American space agency.

Camille Laurin was 76. He had been ill with cancer. Dr. Laurin was a psychiatrist who became active in Quebec politics during the 1960's. He was first elected to the Quebec National Assembly, Quebec's legislative assembly,  in 1970. Dr. Camille Laurin once described his beloved language law as the \"re-conquest\" of Quebec. He was referring to the history of Quebec. During the 18th and 19th century, French-speaking Quebecers were often ruled by governments that were controlled by England. Many French-speaking Quebecers considered themselves to have been conquered by \"les anglais\" - the English. By the 1950's French-speaking Quebecers were increasingly convinced that the only way to stand up for their own rights was for Quebec to become an independent country, separate from Canada. Camille Laurin was among them. Bill 101 required signs in Quebec to be in French. Before Bill 101 became law many signs in Quebec were only in English, even though the majority of the population is French speaking. Bill 101 also required the children of immigrants to go to French schools. Many French-speaking Quebecers were worried that immigrants would choose English schools for their children. That would mean that the French language would slowly die away. Many English-speaking Quebecers did not like Bill 101 because they felt it took away their freedom to put up English signs. They also disagreed with the government telling immigrants which schools they must attend. Bill 101 came into effect in 1977. For many years it was big news in Quebec as there were many demonstrations - both from people who supported the bill and from those who hated it. One thing was never in question, however, was Dr. Laurin's passionate love of Quebec. \"Dr. Laurin was a pioneer, a builder, a man of conviction, determined,\" says Francois Gendron, chairman of the Parti Quebecois caucus in the legislature. Liberal opposition Leader Jean Charest praised his protection of the French language. \"He was a man who was devoted to the interests of Quebec  and in that sense today is a day of sadness for us.\" To some in the English-language community, Laurin symbolized francophones who wanted to crush the anglophone minority. William Johnson, a hardline English-rights activist, said he was personally saddened by the death of his ideological opponent. \"He was very cultivated man, with a seductive charm.\" But the president of the Alliance Quebec English-rights lobby condemned Laurin's masterwork as an attempt to \"wipe out bilingualism\" in Canada. Bill 101 is credited by Quebec nationalists as helping preserve the French language in a sea of English in North America. Dr. Laurin made no apologies for the law's toughness, saying the law simply reflected Quebec's demographic reality. Although it meant a lower profile for anglophones and less clout after years of predominance, Laurin said it took away no basic rights and recognized their institutions, schools and media."}]}, {"title": "Singing Star Helps Bring Music to Northern School", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where did Susan Aglukark's family eventually settle?", "id": "1999-W45-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Arviat, Northwest Territories", "answer_start": 403}]}, {"question": "Who donated the pizza and the $10,000 cheque to Inuksuk High School?", "id": "1999-W45-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences", "answer_start": 714}]}, {"question": "Why did Canadian singer Susan Aglukark make a special appearance at Inuksuk High School?", "id": "1999-W45-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "to present officials with a $10,000 cheque for the purchase of music instruments", "answer_start": 571}]}, {"question": "How long has Inuksuk High School been without a music program?", "id": "1999-W45-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "about 10 years", "answer_start": 812}]}, {"question": "Who should the music society and school provide instruments for, according to Ryan MacLeod?", "id": "1999-W45-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "for some students where food and shelter is a more pressing concern", "answer_start": 1499}]}, {"question": "When did the new musical instruments begin arriving at the high school?", "id": "1999-W45-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "at the beginning of the school year", "answer_start": 1245}]}, {"question": "What proportion of the school's population is enrolled in music classes at Inuksuk?", "id": "1999-W45-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "about a quarter", "answer_start": 812}]}, {"question": "How many students commonly share a single musical instrument?", "id": "1999-W45-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "two or three", "answer_start": 1819}]}, {"question": "Who will be able to use the school's instruments?", "id": "1999-W45-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the music society", "answer_start": 1596}]}], "context": "Students at Iqaluit's Inuksuk High School are celebrating the revival of their music program with singer Susan Aglukark, pizza and a $10,000 cheque today. Born in Churchill, Manitoba, 28 years ago, Susan Aglukark moved around the Northwest Territories for the first twelve years of her life with her father (a Pentecostal minister), her mother and seven brothers and sisters. They eventually settled in Arviat, Northwest Territories, a community of 1,300 people on the northwest shore of Hudson Bay. The Canadian singing star made a special appearance at the high school to present officials with a $10,000 cheque for the purchase of music instruments. The cheque, and an accompanying pizza party, are courtesy of the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Inuksuk has been without a music program for about 10 years. This fall a music teacher was hired and the program was revived with money from the Baffin Divisional Education Council. Inuksuk's new music teacher, Ryan MacLeod, is now building a program from scratch with the help of the new instruments. The money went towards the purchase of 10-15 instruments. In total Inuksuk spent $40,000 on instruments this year, says Inuksuk co-principal Ken Sykes. The instruments arrived at the beginning of the school year. Students can rent instruments from the South, but MacLeod says running a successful music program in the North often requires providing instruments for students. \"We have a wider variety of economic backgrounds here. For some students where food and shelter is a more pressing concern, it is the responsibility of the music society and of the school to provide an instrument,\" MacLeod says. About 90 students, or a quarter of the school's population, are enrolled in music classes at Inuksuk. A single instrument is often shared between two or three students. MacLeod says that, ideally, each student should have his or her own instrument. MacLeod says it is common for northern communities to rally behind music programs. Music is often considered to be as important as subjects such as math or English, but it is a program that can give back to the community, he says. For example, the music society will be able to use the school's instruments and students may perform at community events, MacLeod said. \"Musicians can go out and perform and allow people to experience different emotions,\" MacLeod said."}]}, {"title": "Montreal Students Protest in the Streets", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why were the students protesting?", "id": "1999-W39-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the lack of extra-curricular activities in schools", "answer_start": 161}]}, {"question": "How are Montreal teachers pressuring the provincial government?", "id": "1999-W39-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "by refusing to do any activities that are not paid", "answer_start": 335}]}, {"question": "How large a fine do the students who are arrested face?", "id": "1999-W39-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "$100", "answer_start": 582}]}, {"question": "Who says the disorganized protests are becoming dangerous?", "id": "1999-W39-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "deputy police director Serge Meloche", "answer_start": 594}]}, {"question": "When did students begin to take to the streets of Quebec to express their frustrations?", "id": "1999-W39-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "during the past few days", "answer_start": 785}]}, {"question": "What did police get pelted with during the demonstrations?", "id": "1999-W39-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "rocks and garbage", "answer_start": 1050}]}, {"question": "Where did students rove?", "id": "1999-W39-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "between two east-end high schools", "answer_start": 1088}]}], "context": "Montreal police arrested more than 250 high school students yesterday.

Montreal teachers are in contract discussions with the provincial government. To put pressure on the government, they are refusing to do any activities that are not paid. That's meant that there are no football practices, or school trips, or special classes after school. Those are all activities that teachers do on their own time. The students who were arrested face $100 fines. Deputy police director Serge Meloche says the disorganized protests were becoming dangerous. He says police received reports that some of the teens were being intimidated by fellow students. During the past few days, students have taken to the streets throughout Quebec to express their frustrations. \"Windows of stores were broken, car windows were also broken,\" says Montreal police spokesman Michel Fontaine, who added that police were also pelted with rocks and garbage. The students roved between two east-end high schools and drew between 300 and 400 students at the demonstration's peak.

She blasted off into space aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery. The 35-year-old Quebecer has wanted to go to space since she was 10. She had a poster of Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, on her bedroom wall. \"I was fascinated by those trips the astronauts made to the moon, by their space suits, by their experiences, the equipment they used -- especially the lunar module and the lunar vehicle,\" she says. \"I wanted to be like them. I wanted to be an astronaut.\" Believe it or not, at school Julie used to skip recess so she could do her homework. And she used to exercise so much she would make herself sick. \"I had trouble getting her to stop working,\" says Sister Yolande Perrault, who was her French teacher. \"I would tell her, 'Julie, take a break.'\" Now all that work has paid off. Along with being an astronaut, Julie is a computer engineer, can speak 5 languages (French, English, German, Spanish and Russian), has competed in triathalon races (swimming, running, and biking), is a deep-sea diver, and has a jet pilot's licence. Julie is also interested in the arts - she plays the piano and is a soprano singer. Julie's space dream finally began to come true last year when she was selected for mission STS-96, which was supposed to launch on May 20th, 1999. But fulfilment of her dream had to wait until today, after a hail storm damaged the insulation on the Discovery's fuel tanks a few days before the scheduled launch. Although she will not be the first Canadian woman in space, she will be the first Canadian astronaut to enter and work on the International Space Station platform, launched last year by the United States and Russia. Her tasks will include unloading and arranging the 2,200 kilograms of equipment being carried to the station for future astronauts; working the remote-control Canadarm while supervising crew members constructing parts of the station, and documenting the mission's progress with video cameras. Julie will also have to help change the 18 solar batteries on the station module Zarya. Each battery is roughly the size of a cellular phone. That task will be undertaken with Russian astronaut Valery Tokarev. To make sure the job is done correctly, Payette learned Russian so she could communicate with Tokarev. She has been training for the mission since 1992, when she was first selected to be an astronaut by the Canadian Space Agency. Prime Minister Jean Chretien paid tribute to the Montrealer as a credit to the space program and the country. \"I'm telling you she's creating a great impression in the land. She's very young, very articulate and perfectly bilingual and she's showing the Canadian colours with pride and dignity and we should pray for her that everything will be all right, and it will be,\" said Mr. Chretien Aline Chretien, the Prime Minister's wife, was invited by Julie Payette to watch the launch in Florida. Yesterday evening Aline Chretien told her husband that her friend was \"starting to have butterflies.\" \"I guess I would have a few, too, sitting on that much power,\" said the Prime Minister."}]}, {"title": "A New Look at Marijuana", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is the scientific name for marijuana?", "id": "1999-W10-4-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Cannabis sativa", "answer_start": 385}]}, {"question": "What is the Health Department's study going to examine about marijuana?", "id": "1999-W10-4-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "how the drug should be administered and how a safe supply could be distributed to patients", "answer_start": 802}]}, {"question": "Who has the Canadian Health Department consulted with about obtaining marijuana?", "id": "1999-W10-4-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the Food and Drug Administration in the United States", "answer_start": 1049}]}, {"question": "Why was Mark Crossley sentenced to house arrest?", "id": "1999-W10-4-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "for growing marijuana", "answer_start": 1959}]}, {"question": "Where has marijuana already been approved for medical use?", "id": "1999-W10-4-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "several American states", "answer_start": 3051}]}, {"question": "How long does it take for delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol to be absorbed into the bloodstream when someone smokes marijuana?", "id": "1999-W10-4-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "minutes", "answer_start": 1787}]}], "context": "The federal government has plans to take a new look at the use of marijuana for people who are suffering from painful diseases such as cancer, AIDS and multiple sclerosis. All use of marijuana is now illegal in Canada. But if a scientific study of the drug shows that it can help relieve pain in some people, it could be legalized for medical use only. Marijuana is the common name of Cannabis sativa, a plant which contains more than 400 chemicals. What is commonly referred to as marijuana (\"grass\", \"pot\", \"weed\") in North America is usually made up of crushed cannabis leaves, flowers, and often twigs. Health Minister Allan Rock announced yesterday that his department is putting together guidelines for a scientific look at marijuana. The study would examine how the drug should be administered, and how a safe supply could be distributed to patients. \"There are people who are dying,\" Mr. Rock said. \"They want access to something they believe will help with their symptoms. We want to help.\" The Health Department has already consulted with the Food and Drug Administration in the United States -- which is also planning similar trials -- about acquiring marijuana for the tests. Making marijuana available to patients by prescription will not mean changes to the criminal code. Marijuana could be administered under an existing section of the Food and Drug Act, which allows for special access to prohibited substances. The belief that marijuana eases pain in some patients has been growing -- although people continue to face criminal charges across Canada even when they claim to be using it for medical purposes. THC (delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol) is the main psychoactive part of marijuana. When marijuana is smoked, THC is absorbed from the lungs to the bloodstream within minutes. Mark Crossley is a 38-year-old Nova Scotia man with an inoperable brain tumour.  He was sentenced last week to four months of house arrest and 18 months probation for growing marijuana in his backyard. He said he received the sentence even after the court was told he smoked the drug to deal with the painful headaches and appetite loss caused by his cancer. His doctor approved. Mr. Rock said his announcement is not a step toward a widespread legalization of the drug. \"This has nothing to do with legalizing marijuana,\" he said. But he added, \"I think Canadians support on a compassionate basis, if someone is dying, access to a substance that could alleviate their suffering.\" An Edmonton doctor who specializes in pain management agrees with the federal government's move.  Doctor Helen Hays studied a patient who smoked marijuana to fight the symptoms of a painful muscle disorder. \"There was a tremendous improvement,\" she said. She also says that smoking marijuana brings its own side effects and doesn't work for everyone. \"We all need to know an awful lot more about it.\" Doctors can currently prescribe a synthetic form of marijuana, but it is expensive, and many patients complain that oral forms of the drug don't work as well as smoking it. Several American states have already approved the medical use of marijuana. It was taken to a vote in seven U.S. states and the District of Columbia. A similar bill was also recently presented in the British House of Commons in London."}]}, {"title": "Touching Down on the Red Planet", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What about Mars made skywatchers in ancient Greece and Rome think of their god of war?", "id": "1999-W49-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the planet's fiery red hue", "answer_start": 82}]}, {"question": "How is the Polar Lander being navigated?", "id": "1999-W49-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "by radio signals from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory", "answer_start": 776}]}, {"question": "Who first proposed including a microphone on a spacecraft sent to Mars?", "id": "1999-W49-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "astronomer Carl Sagan", "answer_start": 1292}]}, {"question": "What are scientists afraid the costly mission could do?", "id": "1999-W49-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "hit a rock or lose contact with NASA scientists back home", "answer_start": 1361}]}, {"question": "Where on Mars do scientists know there is frozen water?", "id": "1999-W49-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "in its northern ice cap", "answer_start": 1632}]}, {"question": "Where on Mars do scientists think there may be more water?", "id": "1999-W49-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "underground", "answer_start": 1698}]}, {"question": "What can the Polar Lander's instruments not detect?", "id": "1999-W49-5-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "fossils or living organisms", "answer_start": 2120}]}], "context": "No planet has teased the imagination as much as Mars.

Is there any possibility that there is life there now? Early this afternoon, NASA's Mars Polar Lander touches down on the surface of the red planet. Scientists will get a chance to get the answers to many questions. The Polar Lander has been hurtling through hundreds of millions of kilometres of space for the past 11 months. It's hoped that the $200 million Polar Lander will help solve an old mystery -- whether there's ever been life-sustaining water on Earth's nearest planetary neighbour. The American space ship is being navigated by radio signals from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"It's a very complex process,\" says Sam Thurman, flight operations manager. \"There are literally years of effort by hundreds of different people behind making those five minutes of events happen.\" Once on the surface, the craft's instruments will be deployed -- some to test the atmosphere, others to claw out samples of dust and, possibly, ice. For the first time ever, NASA has included a microphone on a spacecraft sent to Mars, an idea originally proposed by astronomer Carl Sagan. There are fears that the costly mission could hit a rock or lose contact with NASA scientists back home. \"The biggest risk ... is Mars itself,\" says Sarah Gavit, NASA project manager. \"We have never been to the south pole of Mars before and we're not exactly sure what we are going into.\" Frozen water exists on Mars in its northern ice cap. But scientists believe there may be more underground. The Polar Lander will try to find evidence that the atmosphere was once warmer and thicker. Its landing site is believed to be an area where climate changes caused layering of dust and ice that can be read like the rings of a tree trunk. Any answers from the probe would help focus future missions searching for past or present life, which is dependent on water, though the Lander's instruments cannot detect fossils or living organisms."}]}, {"title": "Queen Mum Celebrates her 99th Birthday", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What birthday is the Queen Mum celebrating?", "id": "1999-W32-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "99th", "answer_start": 135}]}, {"question": "Why did Adolf Hitler call the Queen Mum the most dangerous woman in Europe?", "id": "1999-W32-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "because she was so good at boosting the public's spirits", "answer_start": 579}]}, {"question": "What injury did the Queen Mum suffer last winter", "id": "1999-W32-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "broke her hip", "answer_start": 720}]}, {"question": "At whose wedding the Queen Mum do the twist?", "id": "1999-W32-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Prince Edward's", "answer_start": 800}]}, {"question": "How many official homes does the Queen Mother have?", "id": "1999-W32-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "four", "answer_start": 841}]}, {"question": "Why does the Queen Mum face less media pressure than other members of the royal family?", "id": "1999-W32-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "because she is so admired", "answer_start": 904}]}, {"question": "When did the Queen Mother last travel overseas?", "id": "1999-W32-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1989", "answer_start": 1165}]}], "context": "People from all over Britain lined up to catch a glimpse of their favourite royal grandmother, and help the Queen Mother celebrate her 99th birthday on Wednesday.

Ontario's Education Minister Dave Johnson said students, parents and teachers will all be asked to discuss their opinions about uniforms before any final decisions are made. \"Short of a common uniform, there may be a style of dress that may be appropriate within a school,\" Johnson said on Tuesday. \"There are many people in the province who feel that uniforms add a tone of authority and discipline to a school and make for a better learning environment.\" The common code of conduct has started with a new safety policy that requires schools to phone parents to find out why absent students are missing. The code would also deal with acceptable language and set out the punishment for students who smoke, destroy property, steal, distribute hate material or carry a weapon. These are still up for debate. Johnson believes stricter discipline at schools will produce students with better grades and young adults with responsible attitudes. \"If students are dressed in a sloppy manner, that kind of habit and dress may flow over into their learning habits and make it difficult to conduct proper teaching,\" he said. Ontario Premier Mike Harris, 54, believes the province's kids are not what they used to be. He said he remembers the times depicted in the 1950s TV sitcom, Leave it to Beaver.

For violence, the punishment could be expulsion. Marshall Jarvis, head of the Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association, said schools already have policies in place to handle unruly students. \"The school is a microcosm of the society around it.

At least 46 people were killed and hundreds were left injured and homeless. A tornado is an extremely violent windstorm that is usually created within a thunderstorm or hurricane. The recognizable shape of the tornado is the swirling funnel cloud that extends from the base of a storm cloud to the ground. The Oklahoma state medical examiner said 40 people were killed in Oklahoma alone in Monday's storms, the largest of which formed about 110 kilometres southwest of Oklahoma City - cutting a path at least a kilometre wide as it moved north and east. About 400 kilometres miles north, a tornado spawned by the same storm system tossed mobile homes like tin cans, damaged houses and killed at least five people in Wichita, Kansas and its suburb of Haysville. Hospitals reported treating more than 80 people. Fred Irvin of the Sedgwick County Emergency Preparedness Office said today that the initial count of 10 deaths proved wrong when authorities realized victims had been counted twice. But authorities still fear more dead will be found. \"It is worse than what you can see,\" says Bob Thompson, a battalion chief for the Sedgwick County Fire Department. \"We'll probably find more deaths.\" The storm system began in southwest Oklahoma and moved into the neighboring state of Kansas. It included several tornadoes, one of which was nearly two kilometres wide at times. Witnesses say the twister was like a huge white train that came crashing through their homes. Chad Harris was with seven people inside his mobile home in Haysville when it was flipped over and demolished. Two of his companions were critically injured. \"I have no trailer,\" Harris said. \"We all rolled in it. It was the worst experience in my life.\" The Oklahoma City twister is ranked as an F-4 tornado, the second-strongest classification. An F-4 tornado has a wind speed of 333-419 kilometres per hour. It can level well-constructed houses, structures with weak foundations can be blown off some distance, cars are thrown and objects like trees can become airborne like missiles. Scientists rank tornadoes on the Fujita scale of intensity, named after a University of Chicago researcher. On average, only one F-5 tornado hits the United States each year."}]}, {"title": "Blaming the Seals", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How does Newfoundland intend to use a film of seals feasting on cod?", "id": "1999-W11-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "to increase the seal hunt", "answer_start": 58}]}, {"question": "Why has there been a moratorium on cod fishing?", "id": "1999-W11-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "fish stocks dropped to dangerous levels", "answer_start": 1218}]}, {"question": "When was the moratorium instituted?", "id": "1999-W11-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1992", "answer_start": 1207}]}, {"question": "What is the estimated size of the seal herd?", "id": "1999-W11-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "six million", "answer_start": 1619}]}, {"question": "By how much does John Efford want to cut the seal herd?", "id": "1999-W11-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "in half", "answer_start": 1648}]}, {"question": "Where is Dalhousie University?", "id": "1999-W11-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Halifax, Nova Scotia", "answer_start": 1818}]}, {"question": "How much was sealing worth to the Newfoundland economy in 1996?", "id": "1999-W11-3-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "in excess of $11 million", "answer_start": 2447}]}], "context": "The Newfoundland government has a new weapon in its fight to increase the seal hunt: film of cod carnage.

It looks pretty bad,\" says Mary MacNab, the government's seal industry promotions officer. \"From my own impression, it's the killing fields.\" The footage, filmed last week by fishermen using government supplied equipment, shows the ocean floor after a group of seals crowded cod into a bay and started feasting. Lloyd Oldford of Red Cliff, Bonavista Bay, a fisherman who first alerted Efford to the problem, said the video in no way shows the true extent of the destruction fishermen are seeing. \"I can show you 100 miles of it,\" said Oldford. \"There's nothing but dead fish in every crook and cranny. It's everywhere, massive destruction. It's taking away a great source of income from us. If we don't do something about this seal problem, more people are going to be leaving the province.\" John Efford, Newfoundland's fisheries minister, says the \"very disturbing\" images will wake up people to the toll seals are taking on northern cod stocks. There has been a moratorium - a temporary ban -  on fishing for cod since 1992 after fish stocks dropped to dangerous levels. \"We thought by bringing in the moratorium, that in a few years the cod stocks would start to return,\" he says. \"But seven years after the closure of the ground fish industry, stocks today are worse then they were previous to 1992. \"There's only one answer to that.... We've got an overpopulated seal herd.\" Mr. Efford says the seal herd, which is estimated at six million, needs to be cut in half. That would mean increasing the annual quota of 275,000 harp seals to between 475,000 and 575,000 animals. Jeff Hutchings, a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia says it is a stretch for Mr. Efford to use evidence of seals preying on cod in one location to argue for a massive cull (harvest) of the seal herd. \"The degree to which seals are retarding the recovery of cod stocks remains an open question. Maybe they are. Maybe they aren't.\" He adds that documentation of seals having eaten only the fish stomachs suggests scientists may have underestimated how many cod the seals kill. Researchers detect traces of fish in seal stomachs only if they eat the whole fish. Today, sealing comprises a vital part of Newfoundland's sluggish economy. In 1996 alone it was worth in excess of $11 million, with seal products being sold in Canada, Norway and Asia."}]}, {"title": "Surgical Dummies", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is a \"resident\"?", "id": "1999-W26-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a new doctor", "answer_start": 238}]}, {"question": "Where is Mt.

For days the air in towns like Iqaluit will be filled with the sounds of banging hammers and ripping cardboard as the goods they ordered from southern Canada finally arrive by ship. Mild temperatures across the eastern Arctic have produced ideal conditions for the 1999 sealift, moving sailing schedules for many communities forward by several weeks. Environment Canada is forecasting early ice break-up as shippers prepare to carry out the annual resupply of building materials, non-perishable food, cars, snowmobiles and boats. During the long winter months food supplies can only arrive by airplane. Food can cost from twice to three times what it does down south. Northerners are used to paying more than two dollars for a can of pop, more than a dollar for an apple and three dollars for a litre of milk. Believe it or not, a simple head of wilted lettuce can cost five dollars. But large, heavy items cannot be transported by airplane. So northern residents order what they need by catalogue or telephone or the Internet, and wait for the ships to arrive in the spring. \"El Nino as you know lasted well into the winter last year, and we've had above normal temperatures the whole winter in the eastern Arctic and Hudson Bay,\" says Rick Power, a spokesman for the Canadian Ice Service. \"So the ice didn't thicken as much as normal in most areas, and it started to clear a little earlier. \"And of course we've had a very mild spring as well.\" Environment Canada's outlook for ice break-up and clearing patterns predicts smooth sailing in much of James Bay, Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait by the first week of July -- a month earlier than normal. Across the Arctic, ice break-up is expected to be three weeks early, on average. Colin Crosbie, vice-president of Nunavut Ocean Transport, and veteran of the northern sealift, described this year's ice conditions as unprecedented. \"I have been involved in shipping in the Arctic since 1969 and certainly nobody I've talked to who had been up there for decades before had ever seen anything like this,\" he says. \"Five years ago, if we had said we were going to Iqaluit June 25 people would say, 'you're crazy.'\" The extended sealift season is a blessing for the booming construction industry in Nunavut, Canada's newest territory.

The kids are named Clint, Arnold and Danny. This first Canadian cloning could lead to breakthroughs in the treatment of injuries like broken limbs and torn human tissues. The company used the same technology invented by Scottish scientists to clone Dolly the sheep in 1997. Cloning is the first step in a process that could ultimately lead to the mass production of a material known as BioSteel. Biosteel is an artificial spider silk developed by Nexia Biotechnologies. Company president Jeffrey Turner says the silk can be used in tissue repair, neurosurgery and sutures, and to create artificial tendons and ligaments, among other uses. Nexia aims to extract the spider silk from goat's milk. While nobody has yet made a fabric from biosteel, Mr. Turner is convinced the protein can be turned into a supermaterial because of its natural role in the silk of a spider's web. \"When you think of what a web has to do, its extreme strength makes perfect sense,\" he says. The silken threads of the web must be nearly invisible to prey and yet be able to bring a fly to a screeching halt. Clint, Arnold and Danny were born in March. To clone the triplet goats, a nucleus with a mass of cells from a source goat was placed in a petri dish and cultured. One of these cells was then implanted into a mature, unfertilized egg. This replaced the egg's original DNA, which had been removed. This process was done three times, each time using the same source cells. The eggs were then placed into two recipient mothers, with one female carrying two eggs, and the other the third. Because cells were taken from the same source, the three kids have exactly the same genetic makeup. The potential to mass-produce BioSteel is a main reason the animals were cloned in the first place. Mr. Turner says that BioSteel is the strongest substance known to man, with a tensile strength of 300,000 pounds per square inch. BioSteel is an artificial spider silk that is environmentally friendly, extremely strong and light, and compatible with the human body, says Mr. Turner. The company hopes eventually to extract this spider silk from goat's milk. Turner said the company will soon clone a sheep with the spider-silk gene in its genetic makeup. In the past year, the company tried injecting a spider-silk gene directly into the goat. But that system wasn't efficient enough. It worked on only four goats in a hundred. The new method could have close to a 100-per-cent success rate. Next year the company will clone another goat that will carry the spider-silk gene in its chromosomes. The silk protein can be extracted from the goat when it starts to produce milk. Turner said Nexia will clone only about three or four goats with the spider-silk protein. They can then reproduce with normal goats, and their offspring will still have the spider-silk gene in their bodies. But Clint, Arnold and Danny aren't making everyone happy. Some animal-rights activists and ethicists oppose the concept of cloning living beings. Professor Margaret Somerville says she does not agree with cloning for the purposes of creating a superior race of animals -- such as faster race horses or stronger elephants. However, she sees an argument in cloning animals \"for valid, justified purposes.\" The debate around cloning animals, food products and even human beings is growing all across the world. It means that lawmakers are having to sit down to decide what should be allowed, and what should be made illegal."}]}, {"title": "First Artificial Eyes", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What do Jerry's glasses have on them?", "id": "2000-W03-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a tiny camera and an ultrasonic rangefinder", "answer_start": 314}]}, {"question": "When did Jerry get electrodes implanted in his brain?", "id": "2000-W03-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1979", "answer_start": 577}]}, {"question": "How old is Jerry?", "id": "2000-W03-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "62", "answer_start": 224}]}, {"question": "Who helped Jerry see?", "id": "2000-W03-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "John Girvin", "answer_start": 396}]}, {"question": "Where does John Girvin work as a professor?", "id": "2000-W03-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "London, Ontario", "answer_start": 453}]}], "context": "A Canadian brain surgeon is sharing the glory in the development of one of the world's first artificial eyes.

Researchers in New York City say a blind 62-year-old volunteer can now read large letters and navigate around big objects by using a tiny camera wired to computers and a platinum electrode implanted in his brain. John Girvin, a neurosurgery (brain surgery) professor in London, Ontario is the doctor who implanted the electrodes in the patient's brain at the New York Neurological Institute in 1979. It was part of an international research effort to develop artificial sight. Although the research began in 1970, it's taken all these years to develop computers small and powerful enough to process the camera images and send them to the brain. \"When we first did those experiments, it would have taken a room full of computers to process the image,\" says Girvin. \"Now it's small enough for him to carry around on a little pack.\" Although the research began in 1970, it's taken all these years to develop computers small and powerful enough to process the camera images and send them to the brain. \"When we first did those experiments, it would have taken a room full of computers to process the image,\" says Girvin. \"Now it's small enough for him to carry around on a little pack.\" Jerry - the name of the patient - doesn't see images. He perceives specks of light that appear and disappear as his field of vision shifts. But that was enough to help him locate a blackstocking cap hanging on a white wall and place it on the head of a mannequin in a recent demonstration. He also recognized a five-centimetre-tall letter from 1.5 metres away. The blind patient wears glasses with a tiny camera mounted on one lens and an ultrasonic rangefinder on the other. Both devices communicate with the small computer carried on the man's hip. The computer sends signals to small electrodes on the surface of Jerry's brain, using wires entering his skull behind his right ear. It looks like something you would see in a science fiction film. The electrodes stimulate certain brain cells, allowing Jerry to perceive the specks of light. Girvin said the artifician eye has \"great potential,\" but it's hard to predict how fast it can be perfected to something more like real sight. \"The technology is available now. Something could be done one with it in a very few years, but it would take an enormous amount of money and an enormous scientific team.\""}]}, {"title": "Are Albertans Stingy?", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who authored a study on the differences between the rich and poor in Canada?", "id": "1999-W10-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Ms. Armine Yalnizyan", "answer_start": 470}]}, {"question": "How is Alberta's economy doing?", "id": "1999-W10-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "It's growing", "answer_start": 365}]}, {"question": "Where in Alberta, Canada is the difference between rich and poor most noticible?", "id": "1999-W10-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Calgary", "answer_start": 1010}]}, {"question": "Why does Calgary have many high-paying managment jobs?", "id": "1999-W10-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Because it is prosperous.", "answer_start": 45}]}], "context": "Albertans are rich in wealth but poor in spirit, says the author of a recent study.

And if you're not getting it, then you're a loser,''' Ms. Yalnizyan said Thursday during a speech. Yalnizyan added that she did not hear that type of thinking in too many places in Canada. Yalnizyan's report is for the Centre For Social Justice in Toronto. It uses Statistics Canada figures to look at growing income differences between Canada's rich and poor. When Yalnizyan looked at the Alberta data, she discovered that while Alberta's economy is growing, the difference between the rich and poor is expanding more rapidly than anywhere else in Canada. The difference is most noticeable in Calgary where the city's prosperity has meant more high-paying management jobs, but also more unstable and low-paying part-time work. Yalnizyan feels that attitudes are as much to blame for this inequality as government spending cuts, a low minimum wage and the spread of part-time jobs. She argues that cultural expectations are one of the first factors shaping the way the labour market performs. One example, she said, is Albertans' enthusiasm for tax cuts even though the province's health care and education systems are in bad shape, and need tax money to be improved. \"There's a kind of sky's-the-limit attitude.

She's the first immigrant to be named Canada's governor general. The 60-year-old Clarkson was born in Hong Kong in 1939, but came to Canada as a refugee with her family in 1942. She says she remembers a cold and snowy Ottawa with \"white people\" everywhere. Clarkson says the country has evolved since then, when minorities were much less visible. Ms. Clarkson says Prime Minister Jean Chretien approached her \"early in the summer\" about replacing Governor-General Romeo LeBlanc, who had asked to step down. She says she plans to play an active, yet sensible role in Canadian unity. For example, Clarkson says, she and her husband, author John Ralston Saul, plan to use the governor general's Quebec City residence, the Citadel, more often. Clarkson says it's important people remember how Canada was founded on two languages along with native peoples. Clarkson, who currently heads the board of the Canadian Museum of Civilization, officially replaces Romeo LeBlanc on Oct. 7. LeBlanc, who will be 72 in December, was appointed in 1995. \"I am very humbled by the idea of serving beyond, really, what I could ever have expected to do for my country,\" said Clarkson. \"I will do my best to live up to that and to give the best of myself to it.\" \"Madame Clarkson is admired and respected across Canada, a remarkable Canadian of strong intellect, a profound sense of personal integrity, warmth and humanity,\" Chretien said. \"Most important of all, she is a person who loves her adopted country and its people. Her appointment is a reflection of the diversity and inclusiveness of our society, an indication of how our country has matured over the years.\" Clarkson, who lives in Toronto, is best known for her career with CBC-TV, where she was a high-profile interviewer and host for three decades.

Measles is on track to being eliminated throughout North and South America by the turn of the millennium. At least that's the opinion of a number of health experts. Last year Canada had only 12 cases of measles, down from about 2,500 in 1995. \"It has been a surprise to me that measles has disappeared as quickly as it did,\" says Donald Henderson of the Pan American Health Organization. Most children who get measles will have a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, and watery eyes. These symptoms last for 1 or 2 weeks. But measles also causes ear infections in nearly 1 out of every 10 children who get it. As many as 1 out of 20 children with measles gets pneumonia. And about 1 child in every 1,000 who get measles will get encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain that can lead to convulsions, and can leave the child deaf or mentally disabled. For every 1,000 children who get measles, 1 or 2 will die from it. Measles can also make a pregnant woman have a miscarriage or give birth prematurely. Anti-measles immunization began in Canada in 1957. Before that virtually every child went through a bout with the disease. But the single-dose vaccine was not fully effective. In August 1995 an advisory committee recommended that all children be given a second dose of vaccine. The new policy was adopted in all provinces and territories. Rubella, commonly referred to as German measles, is a different disease with similar symptoms. It remains a problem and is one of the next targets for elimination. Measles is the latest in a string of successes for childhood vaccination programs, but experts fear they could be undermined by growing public suspicion about the risks and side-effects of immunization. Last year a group of Manitoba parents went to court in an effort to block a program to immunize Grade Four students against Hepatitis B. They lost their court case, but many parents chose not to have their children vaccinated, says Robert Pless of the federal Laboratory Centre for Disease Control."}]}, {"title": "Her Excellency Adrienne Clarkson", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who delivered the Oath of Office to Adrienne Clarkson?", "id": "1999-W41-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Supreme Court of Canada Justice Claire L'Heureux Dube", "answer_start": 157}]}, {"question": "Where did the swearing-in of Ms. Clarkson take place?", "id": "1999-W41-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Ottawa", "answer_start": 621}]}, {"question": "While in office, what title does Ms. Clarkson assume?", "id": "1999-W41-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Excellency", "answer_start": 437}]}, {"question": "Who did Ms. Clarkson praise during her speech?", "id": "1999-W41-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "her 92-year-old father and her mother", "answer_start": 911}]}, {"question": "When did Ms. Clarkson's family arrive in Canada?", "id": "1999-W41-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1942", "answer_start": 1049}]}, {"question": "How did Ms. Clarkson say her teachers treated her?", "id": "1999-W41-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "\"as bright, not bright yellow\"", "answer_start": 1295}]}, {"question": "As Governor General, who does Ms. Clarkson represent?", "id": "1999-W41-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the Queen of England", "answer_start": 1368}]}, {"question": "As Governor General, Ms. Clarkson presides over the swearing-in of what Canadian officials?", "id": "1999-W41-5-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of Canada and cabinet ministers", "answer_start": 1841}]}], "context": "Former CBC broadcaster Adrienne Clarkson was installed as Canada's 26th Governor General yesterday morning.

The legislation could impose jail sentences on the leaders of the nurses' union if they do not call off the strike immediately. Quebec Federation of Nurses Vice-President Michele Boisclair has said that the Executive of the Federation is prepared to go to jail if that's what it takes.

In restaurants and on the street conversations are about the strike and how nurses deserve to be paid more money. Quebec nurses make between $32,000 and $44,000 a year. They are the lowest-paid nurses in Canada. Premier Bouchard is reluctant to give the nurses' more money because they are only the first of many labour organizations negotiating new contracts. If Bouchard agrees to give the nurses a raise, he will also have to give the other health care groups more money. Quebec ambulance technicians have also threatened to strike, and earlier this week, more than 90 per cent of hospital pharmacists submitted their resignations.

Amen.\" -from a Doukhobor Prayer. British Columbia's ombudsman says the provincial government should apologize to and compensate the children of a controversial religious group who were locked up in an internment camp during the 1950s. An ombudsman is a person who is appointed by a government to investigate individuals' complaints against public authorities. Ombudsman Dulcie McCallum said an investigation found the 170 Doukhobor children were subjected to abuse and suffered \"loss of love, nurturing guidance and childhood\" while they were detained from 1953 to 1959. Children and their parents were members of the Sons of Freedom sect (group) of the Doukhobor faith. The sect strongly condemned private property and government control. They refused to send children to public schools. Provincial officials and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police held the truant children, many of whom spoke only Russian, at a former sanatorium - a hospital for people with tuberculosis - in New Denver, British Columbia, and forced them to attend local public schools. \"The children were caught in a situation not of their own making, nor within their control. They were caught in a web of conflicting values and political turmoil, involving their parents, religious leaders, police and the government,\" Ms. McCallum says in her report. The report said one example of the mistreatment was that children could only visit with their parents through a chain-link fence that the children themselves had been forced to construct. Here what some of the Doukhobors remember about the fence: And for some reason they put up this fence and once in two weeks you get to see your parents through a fence. I mean it was kind of degrading and, the thing is they even had us build the fence, you know. We were digging the holes for the fence. As a child you don't register the impact of it. Like, so they're doing something, they're building a fence. Didn't really question why, and then after, you know, slowly realized that well, wait a minute, we're imprisoning ourselves here. \"As a result of the maltreatment, those who were institutionalized in New Denver suffered harm and continue to suffer from the long-term ill-effects of this trauma,\" wrote Ms. McCallum. She says British Columbia should apologize to the religious sect and compensate the children. Provincial officials are studying the report and preparing a response. \"I want to acknowledge the feelings of the children who were separated from their families. This was a difficult time in British Columbia history,\" Attorney General Ujjal Dosanjn said yesterday."}]}, {"title": "Canadian Superstars at the Grammys", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who was the master of ceremonies for this year's Grammy Awards?", "id": "1999-W09-4-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Rosie O'Donnell", "answer_start": 3133}]}, {"question": "What type of music does Lauryn Hill make?", "id": "1999-W09-4-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "hip-hop", "answer_start": 287}]}, {"question": "How many children does Lauryn Hill have?", "id": "1999-W09-4-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "two", "answer_start": 177}]}, {"question": "Why did Jay-Z not attend the Grammy Awards?", "id": "1999-W09-4-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "he doesn't like the way the Grammys treat rap", "answer_start": 2859}]}, {"question": "What movie was the song \"My Heart Will Go On\" in?", "id": "1999-W09-4-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Titanic", "answer_start": 1787}]}, {"question": "Who wrote \"My Heart Will Go On\"?", "id": "1999-W09-4-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "James Horner and Will Jennings", "answer_start": 1966}]}, {"question": "When did Madonna enter the music business?", "id": "1999-W09-4-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "16 years ago", "answer_start": 1378}]}, {"question": "Who is Will Smith's wife?", "id": "1999-W09-4-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "actress Jada Pinkett Smith", "answer_start": 2555}]}, {"question": "What other form of show business does Will Smith participate in besides music?", "id": "1999-W09-4-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "actor", "answer_start": 2410}]}], "context": "Canadian female music stars were among the big winners at last night's Grammy Awards show in Los Angeles, California.

But Sefa - who recently retired from his job at a theatre after 45 years - said last night it may not take that long for him to decide where to make his new home. \"Maybe we stay here,\" he said as his wife gestured with a nod. Another 10 Albanian refugees will head north to Thompson, Manitoba today to be reunited with family members there. Ninety more refugees with relatives in Manitoba are expected to make their way to the province over the next month. At least 700 more ethnic Albanian refugees are expected in the coming weeks. Hundreds of thousands of refugees are now living in camps just outside of Yugoslavia. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees says those camps are almost full. Aid workers are doing their best to shepherd the refugees to camps that have space. Canada originally planned to take in 5,000 refugees and house them at Canadian Forces bases. But the UN decided it would be better to keep refugees closer to home to ease their return when the war ends. NEWS FLASH The federal government has reopened its plan to airlift 5,000 Kosovo Albanians to refuge in Canada. Canada put the airlift on hold three weeks ago when the UN decided it was better to keep ethnic Albanians driven from Kosovo by Serbian forces close to home. At that time, the UN figured it would be easier to resettle them when a peace deal is reached with Yugoslavia. Immigration Minister Lucienne Robillard says she was asked today to \"reactivate\" the plan by the United Nations agency responsible for refugees. And Ms. Robillard responded that Canada will do so. The minister says the refugees will begin arriving Monday. Ms. Robillard says 300 people a day will be airlifted to Canada for about two weeks."}]}, {"title": "Anti-Smoking Campaign", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who is Canada's Minister of Health?", "id": "2000-W03-4-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Allan Rock", "answer_start": 200}]}, {"question": "Where does the government want to put pictures of diseased lungs?", "id": "2000-W03-4-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "on cigarette packages", "answer_start": 173}]}, {"question": "When does Allen Rock want the new cigarette packages in Canadian stores?", "id": "2000-W03-4-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "by the end of the year", "answer_start": 2230}]}, {"question": "Who is Rob Parker a spokesman for?", "id": "2000-W03-4-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "The Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Association", "answer_start": 1757}]}, {"question": "How much would it cost to change the cigarette packaging, according to The Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Association?", "id": "2000-W03-4-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "millions of dollars", "answer_start": 1879}]}, {"question": "What do anti-smoking organizations think about the cigarette packaging plan?", "id": "2000-W03-4-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "They have applauded the strategy", "answer_start": 1470}]}], "context": "Canada's minister of health has announced a new plan to try to discourage teenagers from smoking: The Yuck Factor. The government wants to put graphic pictures and warnings on all cigarette packages. Allan Rock said yesterday that he's convinced the labels will work. But many of the young smokers he's targeting aren't so sure. The warnings cover half of each side of a cigarette package. There are 16 messages and images, including pictures of diseased lungs. Teenage smokers at a high school in Ottawa say some of the warnings are funny, but others, like an image showing a mouth full of rotting teeth, are disturbing and may make them think twice. \"I have to say this one with the teeth is quite disgusting. And I'm sure it will discourage a few smokers from starting up anyway,\" said one of the teens. But a 17-year-old smoker said he knows all about the dangers of his habit and new warnings won't make him quit. \"If you smoke, you know what's going to happen to you. Just seeing it a warning label is going to gross you out every time you take a cigarette. It's not really going to stop you.\" But Rock believes the warnings will make a difference. He says his department has done extensive surveys and he thinks the labels will be effective. \"Our testing, our focus groups and our surveys demonstrated that the old style warnings are losing their force. It's important for us now to take fresh steps and that's what we're doing today.\" Anti-smoking organizations have applauded the strategy. The Non-Smokers Rights Association says the labels will give people a graphic reminder of the harmful effects of smoking a cigarette. But the plan has a very powerful enemy. The tobacco industry is considering whether it should take the government to court. The Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Association, which represents tobacco companies, says it would take two years and cost millions of dollars to change the packaging on Canadian cigarettes. Spokesman Rob Parker is convinced the warnings won't work. \"They're still doing the same old thing, yelling even louder at smokers to quit or non-smokers not to start. It hasn't worked,\" says Mr. Parker. The minister says he hopes to have the new cigarette packages on store shelves by the end of the year. He says tobacco companies that don't comply won't be selling their product in Canada."}]}, {"title": "A Fatal Train Crash", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where did the two trains collide?", "id": "1999-W41-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "three kilometres west of London's Paddington Station", "answer_start": 201}]}, {"question": "At what time did the trains collide?", "id": "1999-W41-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "8:11 a.m.", "answer_start": 190}]}, {"question": "Who said the initial investigation suggests one of the trains passed warning signals before hitting the other?", "id": "1999-W41-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a British Broadcasting System reporter", "answer_start": 255}]}, {"question": "Why did rescue workers pick through the wreckage?", "id": "1999-W41-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "trying to account for missing passengers", "answer_start": 541}]}, {"question": "What companies operate the trains involved in the crash?", "id": "1999-W41-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Great Western and Thames Trains", "answer_start": 938}]}, {"question": "How many people might have been on the Great Western train?", "id": "1999-W41-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "as many as 500", "answer_start": 1058}]}, {"question": "Where did the Great Western train originate from?", "id": "1999-W41-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": " Cheltenham", "answer_start": 1136}]}, {"question": "How fast were the two trains going when they hit one another?", "id": "1999-W41-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "about 100 km/h", "answer_start": 1386}]}, {"question": "What is a way of daily life for many people in London and the surrounding communities?", "id": "1999-W41-3-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "rail travel", "answer_start": 1475}]}], "context": "Crash investigators in England have begun looking for the causes of a train crash that killed at least 27 people and injured 160 near a London rail station yesterday.

Meanwhile, the search for more victims resumed at dawn today. Rescue workers picked through the wreckage, trying to account for missing passengers. Of the 150 people taken to area hospitals, reports say at least 14 are seriously injured. Many passengers cried as they described how they frantically crawled out broken windows in the aftermath. Others said they were haunted by the cries of those trapped in the wreckage. Authorities could not determine the total number of passengers aboard the trains. Great Western and Thames Trains are the companies that operate the two trains involved in the crash. Great Western said as many as 500 people might have been on board its train, which originated in Cheltenham, northwest of London, and was minutes away from its destination of Paddington Station. The Thames train, which may have been carrying up to 150 passengers, had just pulled out of the London station. Reports said both trains were traveling about 100 km/h when the Thames train tried to cross in front of the Great Western train. Rail travel is a way of daily life for many people in London and its surrounding communities. About 800,000 people travel into and around London by train everyday.

The mudslides narrowly missed several cars and stranded hundreds of travelers. Heavy rains near the B.C. - Alberta border caused the slides. The mud was one metre deep in some areas of the road, and at its height covered all four lanes of the divided highway. After many hours of work, clean up crews were able to re-open the parts of the highway. Parks Canada say it will take several days before all the debris is cleared, and traffic returns to normal. Mudslides often occur in steep and mountainous areas. They are usually caused by weakened land on hills and mountains. Rivers, glaciers, heavy rainfall, melting snow, earthquakes, or even thunder can weaken the land. Once a slope is weakened, almost anything can start a mudslide. Rainstorms are a common cause of mudslides. In heavy storms, water soaks into the ground faster than it can run off. Water pressure loosens soil and rocks. When soil and rocks break loose, they become a mass of wet earth that starts a mudslide. Mudslides can move quickly and powerfully, picking up rocks, trees, houses and cars.

The leader of Austria's Freedom Party flew out of Montreal, Quebec's Dorval airport last night. Haider is accused of being a Nazi sympathizer. Haider has made remarks, for which he has since apologized, that downplay Nazi crimes in Germany in the 1930's and during the Second World War. He has not publicly made anti-Semitic (anti-Jewish) remarks and has said that his party has Jewish members. Haider arrived in Montreal for a visit shrouded in secrecy. Jewish and human rights groups in Canada and the United States condemned his visit. Dozens of people made signs and set up protest marches in Ottawa and Montreal. Rabbi Marvin Hier said he understood Haider had flown to Montreal to try to attend the wedding of a well known Hasidic leader's relative on Wednesday evening. Hasidic Jews believe that religion governs every minute of their life. They are the most visible members of the Jewish community because even their clothes reflect their beliefs. Hundreds of thousands of Hasidic Jews were killed by Nazis. Heshy Weinberger, a spokesman for the Tash Hasidic community in a Montreal suburb, says it is not true that Heider was invited to attend the wedding. Weinberger says the community, which counts many Holocaust survivors among its 300 families, was overwhelmed by the controversy sparked by rumors that they had invited Haider. On Wednesday, Haider's associates requested a tour of Montreal's Holocaust Memorial Center, but were told they could not visit. Haider was also photographed playfully juggling a snowball at the city's memorial to Raoul Wallenberg, a European hero who saved many Jews during the holocaust. This seems to prove accusations that the two-day trip was a bid for publicity. In an interview published in Montreal's The Gazette, Haider said he and the Freedom Party he leads are being unfairly demonized as neo-fascists by his opponents. Haider's party won 27 percent of the vote in Austria's last election, and earlier this month they joined the conservative People's Party in a coalition government. Since then, many European nations have shunned Austria, and its relations with the United States and Canada have been strained."}]}, {"title": "A Canadian Oscar?", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why will Wang Shui-Bo be attending the Oscars this year?", "id": "1999-W10-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "He's been nominated for an award.", "answer_start": 284}]}, {"question": "What is the name of Wang's documentary?", "id": "1999-W10-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "\"Sunrise over Tiananmen Square\"", "answer_start": 950}]}, {"question": "Who fired on the student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square?", "id": "1999-W10-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Chinese government troops", "answer_start": 471}]}, {"question": "When did Wang leave China?", "id": "1999-W10-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "after the student uprising", "answer_start": 1239}]}, {"question": "Where does Wang live now?", "id": "1999-W10-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Montreal, Quebec", "answer_start": 1283}]}, {"question": "Who doesn't need another revolution, according to Wang?", "id": "1999-W10-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the Chinese people", "answer_start": 116}]}], "context": "On Oscar night -- Sunday, March 21 -- actors Tom Hanks, and Gwyneth Paltrow and director Steven Spielberg  won't be the only ones sitting on the edge of their seats, hoping to hear their name read out.

Wang Shui-Bo is nominated for an Oscar for Best Short Documentary for his half-hour film \"Sunrise over Tiananmen Square.\" The film is a Wang's perspective on the events that led up to June 4, 1989, when Chinese government troops opened fire on student demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Wang traces his personal journey through a collage of original artwork mixed with family and archival photographs.  It's a journey that begins with Wang as a loyal Communist, full of the political idealism common in China under the early years of leader Mao Tse Tung. It ends with him as an anti-government activist willing to risk his life to uphold the first stirrings of democracy. \"Sunrise over Tiananmen Square\" shows how the dream starts to fade during the Cultural Revolution in the '60s and '70s, when the Red Guards attack and destroy anything linked to the old Chinese culture. And how the dream is crushed when the tanks roll in Tiananmen Square. Wang fled China after the student uprising and now lives in Montreal, Quebec.  But he was in Beijing when he learned of his Oscar nomination. Even today his film can't be shown in China. But Wang hopes that one day that will change, and explosive subjects such as the Tiananmen Square massacre will no longer be taboo. Wang believes his film delivers a message that the tragedy at Tiananmen should never happen again. \"China doesn't need a revolution. The people here don't need another revolution. We have suffered so much since 100 years ago.\" \"It's time to enjoy life,\" Wang says.

The plane touched down at Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Greenwood, Nova Scotia, at 1 a.m. local time, 10 hours behind schedule. The tired Albanians put on smiles for Red Cross volunteers and military officials. They told waiting reporters they were grateful for the safety Canada provides, but it was clear many will spend their time in Canada dreaming of returning home. On hand to greet his countrymen was Burnaby, British Columbia resident Shamsay Amoosa. Mr. Amoosa fled his homeland six years ago - from a civil war that few outside the country then paid attention to. \"Canada is a good country,\" Amoosa told the refugees. \"You will be safe here until things are better at home and then we will help you go back if you want.\" Ahmet Konyoury, who was on the plane with his wife and youngest daughter, said he didn't want to leave Kosovo. Rather, he had no choice. \"People over there, like Serbian military, said 'You like NATO, go there,' 'You like Clinton, go there,'\" he told CBC News through a translator. The Konyourys were one of the lucky ones who made it to Canada. At the filthy and overcrowded camps on Wednesday, thousands of refugees waited anxiously to hear their names called for overbooked flights to Canada. Officials had overbooked the plane after some families changed their mind at the last minute and didn't show up for the first flight. But on Wednesday, almost all the families lined up for the flight -- plus some. That meant delays as officials tried to sort out who would go and who must stay. Like the Konyourys -- and the refugees who wait still -- each person, each family, has a story about their plight, and their hopes for the future.

The Group of Eight nations, including Russia, the United States, and Canada, have agreed to a seven-point plan to find peace in Kosovo, including the basic terms of an international force to secure the return of refugees. The plan must now be approved by the United Nations Security Council, which represents 185 countries from all over the world.

The Conservatives were able to win a majority government, meaning they will have more members in the legislature than both parties combined. The Conservatives won 29 seats, the New Democrats 12 and the Liberals 11. After the last election Nova Scotia had a minority government. That means that no one party had more than half the seats in the legislature. Hamm has promised to cut people's taxes within three years. He also plans to reduce the number of government workers. Hamm is a 61-year-old doctor with only six years of political experience. His majority win was a comeback for the PC Party. The party placed third in the last election. Liberal leader Russell MacLellan was forced to call the election after the other parties voted against his budget. When the government is defeated on a major bill, like one that is about money, it means the legislature has lost confidence in them. This vote of non-confidence means the premier must either quit, or call a new election. MacLellan decided to call a new election. He says he will stay on as leader of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party despite losing his job as premier."}]}, {"title": "Canadians Participate in Yugoslavian War", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where are the Canadian fighter bombers based?", "id": "1999-W13-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "in Italy", "answer_start": 36}]}, {"question": "What is the goal of the NATO bombing in Yugoslavia?", "id": "1999-W13-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "force Yugoslavia to accept a peace agreement proposed by the United States", "answer_start": 1192}]}, {"question": "How many of the targets they were given did the Canadian fighter bombers hit?", "id": "1999-W13-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "three", "answer_start": 850}]}, {"question": "Why did one pilot not launch his weapons?", "id": "1999-W13-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "he was unable to positively identify the target that he had been assigned", "answer_start": 930}]}, {"question": "Who has been protesting the bombing in Yugoslavia?", "id": "1999-W13-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Serbian Canadians and anti-war demonstrators", "answer_start": 2130}]}, {"question": "When is a demonstration planned for the front of the House of Commons?", "id": "1999-W13-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "tomorrow", "answer_start": 2234}]}, {"question": "Who is Art Eggleton?", "id": "1999-W13-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Defence Minister", "answer_start": 1873}]}], "context": "Canadian bombs hit their targets during NATO's initial attacks on war-torn Yugoslavia, officials announced yesterday. The announcement was made before the CF-18 jets had returned from a second round of battle. Four of the fighter bombers from Bagotville, Quebec returned safely to their Italian base late Thursday after a second day of air strikes aimed at ending ethnic bloodshed in the province of Kosovo. \"The guys are back and they're safe,\" Captain David Muralt said from Aviano. \"They seem to be in pretty good spirits and we're pretty happy to see them back. Everybody's a little expectant when they're gone.\" In Ottawa, Ontario, officials gave the first descriptions of Canada's role in Wednesday's lead wave. \"There were four aircraft and they had four separate targets,\" said lieutenant-general Ray Henault, deputy chief of defence staff. \"Three of the four targets assigned to our aircraft were hit. \"One of the pilots was unable to positively identify the target that he had been assigned and, as a measure and a mark of excellent discipline, he didn't launch his weapons.\" There were no immediate damage estimates. Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy has said the goal is to force Yugoslavia to accept a peace agreement proposed by the United States. It would allow ethnic Albanians in Kosovo to govern themselves. That is what seems to lie at the heart of the conflict. The government of Yugoslavia -- which is mostly Serbian -- does not want to allow the region of Kosovo, where most of the residents are of Albanian heritage, to rule themselves. \"We are trying to deliver the message that military force against civilians is not acceptable,\" Mr. Axworthy said in Winnipeg, Manitoba. \"The targets are those that are military and every effort is being made to keep whatever other casualties to a minimum.\" \"We are trying to stop a humanitarian disaster,\" Defence Minister Art Eggleton told the House of Commons. \"We must, in fact, ensure that this genocide comes to an end.\" Yugoslavia is thought to have dangerous air defences, including surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft guns. Over the past three days Serbian Canadians and anti-war demonstrators have been holding protests in a number of Canadian cities. Tomorrow there will be a demonstration in front of the House of Commons."}]}, {"title": "First Man to be Buried on the Moon", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What was Eugene Shoemaker's lifelong wish?", "id": "1999-W31-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "to go to the moon", "answer_start": 55}]}, {"question": "How big is the container holding Shoemaker's ashes?", "id": "1999-W31-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "lipstick-sized", "answer_start": 112}]}, {"question": "Where is the Lunar Prospector supposed to crash-land?", "id": "1999-W31-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the moon", "answer_start": 64}]}, {"question": "What is NASA hoping the Lunar Prospector will create when it crash-lands?", "id": "1999-W31-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a plume of water which will be visible from Earth with a telescope", "answer_start": 506}]}, {"question": "On what was Shoemaker considered an authority?", "id": "1999-W31-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "craters and the collisions that cause them", "answer_start": 764}]}, {"question": "How many comets is Shoemaker credited with discovering?", "id": "1999-W31-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "about 20", "answer_start": 840}]}, {"question": "When did Shoemaker discover the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9?", "id": "1999-W31-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1994", "answer_start": 910}]}, {"question": "What did Shoemaker-Levy 9 slam into?", "id": "1999-W31-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Jupiter", "answer_start": 991}]}, {"question": "Whom did Shoemaker teach about craters?", "id": "1999-W31-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Apollo astronauts", "answer_start": 1251}]}, {"question": "Why was Eugene Shoemaker rejected for astronaut training?", "id": "1999-W31-5-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "because of a medical problem", "answer_start": 1120}]}, {"question": "What was Eugene Shoemaker's biggest disappointment in his life?", "id": "1999-W31-5-11", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "\"not going to the moon and banging on it with my own hammer\"", "answer_start": 1367}]}], "context": "Eugene Shoemaker may finally fulfill his lifelong wish to go to the moon. If all goes as planned on Saturday, a lipstick-sized container will carry his ashes to the moon's south pole. Shoemaker will be the first human to be laid to rest on another celestial body. His ashes will be aboard NASA's Lunar Prospector. The Lunar Prospector is a moon-orbiting craft. It is expected to crash land on the moon early Saturday morning. NASA is hopeful that the impact of Prospector's crash into the moon will create a plume of water which will be visible from Earth with a telescope. NASA scientists are hopeful that this experiment will help them learn about the moon's water reserves. Shoemaker was a well-known astronomer and geologist. He was considered an authority on craters and the collisions that cause them. He is credited with discovering about 20 comets and 800 asteroids. Shoemaker gained worldwide fame in 1994, when he helped discover the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. The comet slammed into Jupiter in 1994. It was always Shoemaker's dream to go to the moon. He applied to be an astronaut in the 1960s, but was rejected because of a medical problem. He later worked on several U.S. space missions, including the Apollo missions to the moon. He taught Apollo astronauts about craters. Shoemaker said shortly before his death the biggest disappointment in his life was \"not going to the moon and banging on it with my own hammer.\""}]}]}
