And it's got nothing to do with what students are watching in their spare time at home. It's about teens having to watch commercials in school. Every day. It's a controversy about the growing commercialization of schools. Youth News Network, a private news and current-affairs network, has installed a satellite dish and thousands of dollars worth of televisions and audio-visual equipment at Meadowvale Secondary School free of charge. It expects to start broadcasting its 12-minute newscast -- complete with 2 1/2 minutes of commercials -- every day to the school's 1,700 students starting in September. But along with the bonanza of technology, the school is inheriting a political hot potato. \"I happen to believe that it is completely unacceptable to sell off little bits of our kids,\" said Heather-Jane Robertson, director of professional development with the Canadian Teachers Federation. \"If we don't understand that it's wrong to sell off our kids to advertisers, to compromise public education in that way, then we can hardly turn around and blame the people who want to make money off our stupidity.\" Some educators say YNN serves as an example of the wave of commercialization sweeping over schools at a time when funding cuts are forcing public boards to look to businesses for help. While public broadcasters such as CBC Newsworld and TV Ontario provide programming free of charge to schools, none can come close to providing the wealth of televisions, VCRs, computers, and video cameras installed at Meadowvale under its pilot project with YNN's owner, Montreal-based Athena Educational Partners Inc. Meadowvale principal Laurie Pedwell conceded that the technology was part of YNN's appeal. But she insisted that the sample broadcast viewed by students last November was balanced and suitably tailored to teenagers. As for the advertisements, she said none was offensive or aggressively pushing a product, and most depicted teenagers positively. The school has a June deadline to decide whether it wants to sign a five-year contract with YNN. Stephanie Lake is a grade twelve student at Meadowvale secondary. She recently wrote this essay about YNN coming to her school. \"We may be teenagers, but we're not all couch potatoes!  Well, at least we weren't. Who knows, maybe one day soon, secondary school students all across Canada will be the same - walking, brainwashed zombies.  The blame for this can be placed squarely on the shoulders of YNN and the governors of our education system. Trust the government. I don't think so! I am upset with the administration of my school for using us, the students, as guinea pigs, in a test which uses televisions inappropriately in my school.

For days the air in towns like Iqaluit will be filled with the sounds of banging hammers and ripping cardboard as the goods they ordered from southern Canada finally arrive by ship. Mild temperatures across the eastern Arctic have produced ideal conditions for the 1999 sealift, moving sailing schedules for many communities forward by several weeks. Environment Canada is forecasting early ice break-up as shippers prepare to carry out the annual resupply of building materials, non-perishable food, cars, snowmobiles and boats. During the long winter months food supplies can only arrive by airplane. Food can cost from twice to three times what it does down south. Northerners are used to paying more than two dollars for a can of pop, more than a dollar for an apple and three dollars for a litre of milk. Believe it or not, a simple head of wilted lettuce can cost five dollars. But large, heavy items cannot be transported by airplane. So northern residents order what they need by catalogue or telephone or the Internet, and wait for the ships to arrive in the spring. \"El Nino as you know lasted well into the winter last year, and we've had above normal temperatures the whole winter in the eastern Arctic and Hudson Bay,\" says Rick Power, a spokesman for the Canadian Ice Service. \"So the ice didn't thicken as much as normal in most areas, and it started to clear a little earlier. \"And of course we've had a very mild spring as well.\" Environment Canada's outlook for ice break-up and clearing patterns predicts smooth sailing in much of James Bay, Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait by the first week of July -- a month earlier than normal. Across the Arctic, ice break-up is expected to be three weeks early, on average. Colin Crosbie, vice-president of Nunavut Ocean Transport, and veteran of the northern sealift, described this year's ice conditions as unprecedented. \"I have been involved in shipping in the Arctic since 1969 and certainly nobody I've talked to who had been up there for decades before had ever seen anything like this,\" he says. \"Five years ago, if we had said we were going to Iqaluit June 25 people would say, 'you're crazy.'\" The extended sealift season is a blessing for the booming construction industry in Nunavut, Canada's newest territory. This year, Iqaluit is very scarce on materials, so the fact that it's going to open up early is a positive thing,\" says Suzanne Paquin, vice-president of Nunavut Eastern Arctic Shipping said."}]}, {"title": "\"The Great One\" Hangs Up His Skates", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How long did Gretzky dominate the sport of hockey?", "id": "1999-W17-1-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who won the last game Gretzky played?", "id": "1999-W17-1-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where did Gretzky play his last hockey game?", "id": "1999-W17-1-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why will the number 99 never be worn again by a professional hockey player?", "id": "1999-W17-1-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When did Gretzky's parents tell him they were proud of him?", "id": "1999-W17-1-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why did Gretzky say he was \"devastated\"??", "id": "1999-W17-1-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How will Wayne Gretzky be competing again?", "id": "1999-W17-1-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What did Gretzky do when he saw a youngster's hand extended from the crowd?", "id": "1999-W17-1-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who played with Gretzky on the Edmonton Oilers?", "id": "1999-W17-1-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "Number Ninety-Nine retired from professional hockey yesterday afternoon, but less than 24 hours later he's not shying away from sports. Later today Wayne Gretzky will be competing again. At four o'clock this afternoon, the player hockey fans say is probably the best the game has ever known, and that some people say is the greatest professional athlete ever will be... bowling. The revelation came late in yesterday's news conference. In front of hundreds of reporters from all over North America and Europe Wayne Gretzky announced that he was going to hit the 10-pin bowling lanes in New York City. \"I'm going to spend the afternoon with my teammates - a bowling party and I'm looking forward to it, I'm going to enjoy. I've only bowled in Canada and it's five pin, they tell me here its 10 pin. I don't know if I can lift the ball. \" Yesterday was an emotional day for Gretzky fans. With tears and typical grace, Wayne Gretzky skated away from professional hockey. It's the second time in three months that one of the world's premier athletes has chosen to retire. \"It was a tough game for me today,\" Mr. Gretzky said of his farewell from the sport he dominated for two decades. \"I wanted it to be a celebration. \"You know, this is not a passing on,\" he added, his eyes watery. \"This is a moving on.\" It was a moving scene as the sport's greatest player said goodbye. The National Hockey League also retired No. 99, which commissioner Gary Bettman announced would never be worn in the league again. Gretzky has been the National Hockey League's Michael Jordan -- an almost mythical figure that fans of all teams admired and packed arenas to see. Perhaps fittingly, Jordan himself appeared in a second-period video, telling Gretzky, \"Your golf game is not going to get better, so don't think that will help. Relax and enjoy being a dad.\" \"It's always too soon when you see a great player retire,\" said Mario Lemieux, the retired Pittsburgh Penguins centre. \"It's going to be very difficult for the National Hockey League to lose the best hockey player that ever played, and he's been such a great ambassador for the game for 20 years.\" In front of Lemieux sat Mark Messier - who played with Mr. Gretzky for the Edmonton Oilers - and many other former teammates and opponents who admired \"The Great One\". When the game was over (the Penguins won 2-1) Gretzky smiled through tears during four final laps of Madison Square Garden. He skated slowly enough for plenty of souvenir photos to be taken of the player who holds or shares 61 NHL records. Whenever he noticed a youngster's extended hand from the crowd, he touched it. He even played to the fans, donning a blue Yankees hat, then a red Rangers beret. Then, almost as suddenly as word had come last week that he was retiring, Number 99 was gone. \"I'm devastated I will no longer be a hockey player,\" said Wayne Gretzky, 38, his eyes still red, said more than an hour after his final skate. \"I will miss every part of the game, because I loved every part of the game. \"But I've made the right decision.\" As he left the arena, Wayne's father and mother told him they were proud of him."}]}, {"title": "America Mourns JFK Jr", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where did John Jr's plane crash?", "id": "1999-W30-1-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What does it mean when a \"search and rescue\" mission becomes a \"search and recovery\" mission?", "id": "1999-W30-1-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why does the U.S. Coast Guard want to find the plane's crash site?", "id": "1999-W30-1-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who was John F.

Kennedy is the son of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy. The U.S. coast guard searched all weekend for any sign of the plane or survivors. On Sunday, they announced the end of the rescue mission.

A suitcase belonging Lauren, a prescription bottle with Carolyn's name, and pieces of a plane similar to Kennedy's were all found in the water. They also found bits of foam insulation believed to have come from the airplane. The Kennedy family is no stranger to tragedy. In 1963, John Jr's father, U.S. President John F.

Armine Yalnizyan, an economist who studied the differences between Canada's rich and poor,  found that the difference between rich and poor was growing fastest in Alberta. Yalnizyan also noted that Albertans are extremely competitive, and have a \" law of the jungle\" view of life. It's this outlook of, `If you can get it, keep it. And if you're not getting it, then you're a loser,''' Ms. Yalnizyan said Thursday during a speech. Yalnizyan added that she did not hear that type of thinking in too many places in Canada. Yalnizyan's report is for the Centre For Social Justice in Toronto. It uses Statistics Canada figures to look at growing income differences between Canada's rich and poor. When Yalnizyan looked at the Alberta data, she discovered that while Alberta's economy is growing, the difference between the rich and poor is expanding more rapidly than anywhere else in Canada. The difference is most noticeable in Calgary where the city's prosperity has meant more high-paying management jobs, but also more unstable and low-paying part-time work. Yalnizyan feels that attitudes are as much to blame for this inequality as government spending cuts, a low minimum wage and the spread of part-time jobs. She argues that cultural expectations are one of the first factors shaping the way the labour market performs. One example, she said, is Albertans' enthusiasm for tax cuts even though the province's health care and education systems are in bad shape, and need tax money to be improved. \"There's a kind of sky's-the-limit attitude. What's mine is mine. And the more disparate incomes get, the more accentuated these attitudes get, and more of a lottery mentality occurs.\""}]}, {"title": "An Arctic Struggle", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where in the Canadian Arctic are the 50 beluga whales trapped?", "id": "1999-W27-2-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why have the whales become trapped?", "id": "1999-W27-2-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Through what are the whales breathing?", "id": "1999-W27-2-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who is trying to save the whales?", "id": "1999-W27-2-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Even in the best of conditions, how long can beluga whales stay under water?", "id": "1999-W27-2-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How are the bears killing the whales?", "id": "1999-W27-2-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "A group of 50 beluga whales is fighting to stay alive in an icy trap in the Canadian Arctic near Ellesmere Island.

Ms. Gutnick has been opposed to the bombing since it began on March 24. She wants to hear the opinions of the refugees and try and better understand what is happening in Yugoslavia. So far nearly 5,000 Kosovo refugees have come to Canada. But they won't be the last displaced Kosovars headed here. More refugees will continue to arrive under Canada's family reunification plan. \"Some 2,000 people have been identified as potentially eligible for that program. Of those, 400 have already arrived,\" says Raphael Girard, Canada's ambassador to Yugoslavia. Canada has set no limit for the number of refugees eligible for the family reunification plan. When the airlift ends Wednesday, Canada will have fulfilled its pledge to accept 5,000 refugees. Officials say Ottawa won't take in more unless requested by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Out of 135,000 spaces for refugees offered by the international community, only 55,000 have been transported out of the region in the last month. The ambassador said that there is anxiety among the Kosovar leadership that by taking refugees so far afield \"many of these people will not return and in so doing Yugoslavia President Slobodan Milosevic's agenda (of getting rid of ethnic Albanians living in the southern Yugoslavian province of Kosovo) will be achieved.\" In total, 1.6 million people have fled Kosovo as Yugoslavian Serb forces purge the province of ethnic Albanians.

But, diabetics will have to be patient -- a cure for humans is between five and 10 years away. However, that didn't temper the enthusiasm of diabetic Holly McWilliams. \"This is very exciting,\" said the 18-year-old Calgarian who has had to inject insulin four times a day since she was three years old to stay alive. She now uses an insulin pump to maintain proper levels of the hormone. Diabetics are at risk of blindness, circulatory problems, heart disease and kidney failure, but with proper diet, exercise and insulin, it can be controlled. There are at least two strands of diabetes: Type 1 -- when the body doesn't produce insulin. Type 2 -- when insulin in the body doesn't work properly. Dr. Ji-Won Yoon's discovery affects Type 1 diabetics, which inflicts about 100,000 Canadians. One and a half million Canadians have diabetes; more than 750,000 have it and don't know it. \"This is a major landmark study and it helps us understand the disease in a way we haven't in the past,\" says Dr. David Lau of the Julia McFarlane Diabetes Research Centre. Dr. Yoon's research on mice focuses on how a diabetic's immune system attacks cells that produce insulin, which is needed to help the body properly use sugars. A protein in the pancreas, which produces insulin, plays a critical role in triggering diabetes in mice. Destruction of insulin-producing cells by the immune system can be prevented by halting protein production. Dr. Yoon said his work could lead to transplants of tissue that fight the sugar build-up process or possibly a vaccine. Lau is confident studies on mice will also work on humans."}]}, {"title": "Maple Leaf Gardens Closes its Doors", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What type of sports facility does Maple Leaf Gardens function as?", "id": "1999-W07-4-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When was the Maple Leaf Gardens built?", "id": "1999-W07-4-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where is the Maple Leaf Gardens?", "id": "1999-W07-4-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How far did Brent Shuya and his son have to drive just to reach Winnipeg?", "id": "1999-W07-4-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When did Foster Hewitt start broadcasting Maple Leaf games on the radio?", "id": "1999-W07-4-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where did Tommy and Ruth sit for the Leaf's games at the Gardens?", "id": "1999-W07-4-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who was known as one of the toughest players in the NHL in the 1950s?", "id": "1999-W07-4-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "Maple Leaf Gardens. More than a hockey rink, it's a cultural institution. It may well be the strongest link between Toronto and the rest of Canada. And this weekend, the Gardens are losing the Maple Leafs. For thousands of people from coast to coast to coast, this Saturday is a special hockey night in Canada. It will be the last time the Leafs take to the ice at Maple Leaf Gardens. With the end in sight, the hype -- and mourning -- is beginning in earnest. More than one building in one city, the Gardens has long been a focal point for Canadian culture -- at least for anyone who has ever strapped on the blades. For decades, NHL games were broadcast into living rooms From Plum Coulee, Manitoba to Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia, and beyond from one of two places -- the Gardens or the Montreal Forum. With the end in sight, fond memories are starting to flow. In recent weeks, for example, hockey fans from Western Canada have been making the trek to Toronto to see one last game at the Gardens. Two weeks ago Brent Shuya and his son made the 3-and-a-half hour drive from their home in Russell, Manitoba to Winnipeg. There they hopped on an airplane for another two hour ride to Toronto.  The reason: to see their one and only hockey game at Maple Leaf Gardens. Brent says, \"it was pretty important to me, I wanted my son to go and visit the Gardens, seeing how they are not going to be playing there anymore. I've always been a Leaf fan probably since I was five or six years old and I guess I always will be whether they win or lose, and it was just nice to see them play in their old home.\" But Brent Shuya is by no means the only western hockey fan who has made one final pilgrimage to Maple Leaf Gardens. On his trip he met other fans from the Prairies doing the same thing. There is no one explanation as to why some fans outside Toronto feel such a strong attachment to the Leafs and the building in which they play, although radio and television have had much to do with it. Fans like Winnipeg businessman Jeff Thompson will be at the final game on Saturday. \"The Gardens and the Montreal Forum were both places that although we were never there, as kids growing up we were there,\" he says. \"They came into our house every weekend. It became larger than life because we had grown up watching it\". Winnipeger Bill Juzda was known as one of the toughest players in the NHL when he played for the Leafs in the 1950s. Mr. Juzda expects many of those at the final game Saturday will feel pretty much the way he did when he first walked into Maple Leaf Gardens nearly 50 years ago. He says, \"you walked in and you seen all those pictures in the lobby and everything else. And you stood outside and said, hey, I used to listen to Foster Hewitt on the radio and boy am I lucky to be here.\" Foster Hewitt was the Maple Leafs' radio broadcaster for decades. His voice was known by Canadians from coast to coast. He first broadcast a hockey game on the radio in March, 1923. Decades later he became the Leafs' first television announcer. In Toronto, many residents are sad to see the Leafs abandon the Gardens for the new Air Canada Centre. One fan is Tommy Gaston.

But roughly 1,500 residents were able to return to their homes last night as winds died and the danger decreased. A number of homes and businesses on the town's northern edge were destroyed. And the evacuees remained on alert, ready to run again on a moment's notice if hot spots flared up. La Ronge is a community of 2,800 people located 300 kilometres north of Saskatoon. It is located on lac La Ronge. Residents \"have to go back with the understanding that they could be called out at any moment,\" says RCMP Cpl. Gary MacDonald. Although the evacuees were told they could spend the night in the local arena, virtually all the townspeople chose to sleep in their own beds. Volunteer firefighters were to remain on patrol all night, ready to run door-to-door and give the alert if winds picked up and sparked a new blaze. Trees were still burning at Gary Vettree's in Eagle Point, which was directly in the path of a fast-moving fire. His was one of two homes still standing; seven houses just down the road burned to the ground. Vettree saved his house by soaking it with water. \"Scary, really scary,\" he says of the blaze, \"Smoke, fire, animals running all over, rabbits, birds.\" After days of dry winds and electrical storms - there have been 3,000 lightning strikes over the last couple days - the fire began in the bush southwest of town at about noon Thursday. Strong winds pushed it northeast and by 1 p.m., when the fire grew dangerously close to a bulk fuel station, RCMP were running from door to door asking people to leave. \"People were crying,\" says one resident, who loaded up his photo albums and hooked his prized boat to his car before leaving his home with his wife. \"At that point the fire was about a quarter-mile away.\" The fire shot six metres above the trees as it roared through the industrial area of town. Highway 2 was closed. \"I watched the fire, when it was just feet away from an industrial shop, burn the end of the building,\" said the man, who didn't want his name used. Evacuees were housed in the local health clinic and a hockey arena. \"In some places it was so bad you could hardly see,\" says restaurant worker Angela Krienke. Some evacuees with respiratory problems received treatment. There are 459 firefighters fighting the fires in Northern Saskatchewan. Working or on standby for fire suppression activities are: 24 helicopters, 12 water bomber aircraft, 8 bulldozers and 1 swamp tractor. Early damage estimates include a shop burned out in the industrial area. Several mobile homes were destroyed, as were four large buildings and four cabins at a local lakeside resort. No injuries were reported. \"It's amazing that so much vegetation on the perimeter of our community was totally destroyed and we were very fortunate that so little property was destroyed,\" says La Ronge Mayor Joe Hordyski. \"It's just a miracle.\" In northern Alberta, meanwhile, a forest fire just north of Fort McMurray threatened the region's power supply as it burned out of control Thursday. There are a number of fires burning near Fort McMurray, three out of control. None were threatening the town. Lower winds and less smoke removed the need to evacuate the small aboriginal community of Janvier, about 120 kilometres southeast of Fort McMurray."}]}, {"title": "The State of Texas Executes Canadian", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "When was the last time a Canadian was executed in the United States?", "id": "1999-W25-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Of which province in Canada was Stanley Faulder a native?", "id": "1999-W25-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What would a stay of execution have allowed?", "id": "1999-W25-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How was Faulder killed?", "id": "1999-W25-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What has Charlene Gingera been working with the Faulder family to do since 1997", "id": "1999-W25-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why did Texas Governor George W.

After 22 years on death row, the Alberta native became the first Canadian to be executed in the U.S. since 1952. He was sentenced to death for the 1975 murder of a Texas woman. A last-minute appeal to the Supreme Court to stop the execution was rejected, and Texas Governor George W. Bush said he would not issue a stay of execution. A \"stay of execution\" delays the execution, and would have allowed Mr. Faulder's lawyer to continue her quest to allow him to live. The United States placed itself above international law, says a friend of the late man's family. \"The United States is one of our world leaders and world powers, and yet they allow the basic human rights of people to be violated in their own country,\" said Charlene Gingera, about an hour after Faulder was killed by an injection of deadly chemicals. Ms. Gingera spoke on behalf of family members who wanted to grieve Faulder's death privately. She was referring to the fact that both Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy and his U.S. counterpart, Madeleine Albright, agreed Faulder was denied his international rights because Texas officials failed to tell Canadian diplomats that he was in jail. Most countries in the world have agreed that this must be done when they arrest a citizen of another country. Texas Governor and presidential candidate George W. Bush refused to grant a stay of the execution, saying there was no new evidence that questioned the jury's verdict in the death of Inez Phillips, who Faulder was convicted of killing in 1977. \"Had Stan Faulder been a Texan in Iran or Serbia and he was not notified of his right to seek help from the U.S. consulate had he been detained, would the U.S.A. tolerate it? I don't think so,\" Ms. Gingera says. \"They are undermining international law by saying that Texas has to go ahead with what they believe to be right.\" Ms. Gingera has been working with the Faulder family since 1997 to try to get human rights groups interested in the case. She acknowledges that Americans fighting the death penalty are just a few small voices. But she adds: \"I think Stan's death will certainly be a loud voice. There are many people from around the world who responded to his case and that will not go unheard.\" Ms. Gingera says she was alarmed by comments from Alberta Reform Member of Parliament Cliff Breitkreuz, who wanted Texas officials to ignore the argument that Mr. Faulder's rights were violated when he wasn't told he could contact Canadian consular officials when he was charged with murder. \"It's frightening to see people like... Cliff Breitkreuz and various people in the province of Alberta or Canada who say it's OK to ignore a violation of international law, it's OK to ignore a violation of human rights....\" She says while Faulder's supporters struggled with their anger Thursday, the inmate himself was peaceful. \"Stan's peace had really spread to many people and his peace truly helped his friends and family around him to be filled with a sense of peace.\" In the last few days, Mr. Faulder's relatives had hoped for a stay of execution but they weren't overly optimistic, she says. \"They did know that this was something that could really happen.\" Canada does not execute prisoners."}]}, {"title": "Canada's Wartime Guests", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What happened in Europe and England when Geoffrey was nine years old?", "id": "1999-W08-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where did Geoffrey Dewis live before he was nine?", "id": "1999-W08-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How many British children were evacuated under the Commonwealth child evacuation program?", "id": "1999-W08-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why did CBC produce \"Canada Calling\"?", "id": "1999-W08-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When did Geoffrey Dewis die?", "id": "1999-W08-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who published Dewis's obituary?", "id": "1999-W08-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "This week the National Post newspaper published an obituary of Geoffrey Dewis, a man who died in Vancouver at the age of 69. Mr. Dewis was not a famous person himself, but he was part of a remarkable event in Canadian history. In 1939, the Second World War began in Europe and England. Geoffrey Dewis was then nine.  His parents feared that Geoffrey and his older sister would be killed in the Nazi bombing of England. But there was a way to keep the kids safe. They took advantage of the Commonwealth child evacuation program.  Over 2,600 British children were sent to live with families in other Commonwealth countries where the war was not raging. Over half of those children -- 1530 of them -- came to live in Canada as guests. Some, like Geoffrey Dewis, returned to Canada to spend the rest of their lives. During the war, the trip to Canada was not easy.  German submarines lurked in the North Atlantic sea where the boats traveled. They fired torpedoes at British and Allied ships. Geoffrey Dewis's ship was the last to arrive safely at its destination.  The next boatload of British kids, on a ship called The City of Benares, was torpedoed and sank. Seventy-seven children on board died. Tragically, that was the end of the \"guest child\" program. During their stay in Canada, CBC Radio produced a program called \"Canada Calling\" so that the British kids who were separated from their families could speak to their parents and friends back home over the airwaves."}]}, {"title": "Surgical Dummies", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is a \"resident\"?", "id": "1999-W26-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where is Mt.

They believe the Canadian wrestler's costume had something to do with the tragedy. The accident happened Sunday at a World Wrestling Federation event. Owen Hart was being lowered into the ring from the rafters of the arena. Police say Mr. Hart's cape may have been tangled with the release cord on his harness, causing it to release too early. Mr. Hart fell 18 metres into the ring. Mr. Hart's brother Ron blames the accident on the Wrestling Federation's constant search for more spectacular stunts and the desire to attract more television viewers. The WWF says the stunt will never be performed again. It seems it takes more than a full nelson or a vicious body slam to impress the rabid pro wrestling fans of the '90s. \"Frankly, wrestling was getting so far out and my poor brother Owen was a sacrifice for the television ratings,\" says Owen's sister Ellie Hart. Yesterday brother Bret \"Hitman\" Hart, also a wrestler, told an American televison network that Owen was uneasy about the stunt, \"but somehow over the weekend he got talked into doing it again.\" \"We're professional wrestlers,\" Bret Hart said. \"We take our falls on the mat, inside the ring. \"I was never a stuntman, and my brother Owen was never a stuntman.\" Keith Pelley, who is vice-president of programming for the Canadian television network TSN (which carries wrestling), says the WWF's ratings are among his network's highest. TSN carries the WWF's Raw is War show every week. \"The WWF and curling are probably our two highest-rated shows. You would be surprised by how many closet wrestling fans there are. The average viewer is 18 to 49, with the 34 to 49 age group being very dominant.\" Wrestling is now so mainstream that a former star Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura was elected governor of the American state of Minnesota, and Hulk Hogan is considering running for president of the United States. But that has not stopped many people from questioning the violent nature of the sport and wondering if more restrictions should not be put on when it is aired. Wrestling is one of the world's oldest sports. There are dozens of varieties practiced all over the world, from Sumo wrestling in Japan to Greco-Roman wrestling practiced in Europe. Professional wrestling has nothing to do with amateur wrestling.

Ocalan leads a separatist group that has fought for the creation of an independent Kurdistan. Kurds live in lands controlled by Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria. An estimated 20,000 people have died in the fighting of the past 15 years. In London, England, the Greek embassy was temporarily occupied, and hundreds of Kurds are continuing to protest outside the embassy. In Ottawa on Wednesday, Kurdish demonstrators hurled a gasoline bomb at a police line, setting one officer on fire. The group of 400 protesters was fighting with a riot squad outside the Turkish Embassy. In all, 10 police officers were injured in the fighting. In Greece, the foreign minister, the interior minister and the public order minister handed in their resignations because they failed to protect the Kurdish rebel leader. Ocalan was captured earlier this week while hiding in the Greek embassy in Kenya. Turkey considers Ocalan an enemy because he's been fighting an ongoing battle for a separate Kurdish homeland. He could face the death penalty. Ocalan's supporters have been protesting at Turkish, Greek and Israeli embassies in Europe and Canada. On Wednesday, after rumours that Israel helped Turkish securities forces capture Ocalan, angry Kurds tried to occupy the Israeli consulate in Berlin. Israeli guards opened fire on the protesters, killing three and injuring 16 others. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to calm Kurdish anger. But he defends the killings and says his nation had nothing to do with Ocalan's arrest. In Germany, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told the Kurds they must obey German laws and stop violent protests -- or they will be thrown out of the country. In Turkey, police have reportedly arrested hundreds of supporters of the main Kurdish party, while up to 4,000 soldiers have been sent into Northern Iraq to attack Kurdish rebel bases.

The deal also guarantees the Inuit rights to hunting and fishing on the land and ocean in the area, rights to participate in wildlife and resource management, and environmental protection.

The two boys who carried this out belonged to a group of teenagers who called themselves the \"Trenchcoat Mafia.\" There are reports that a bomb exploded late Tuesday night as police tried to remove it. A spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department has said bomb squads may need several days to complete searching the school for explosives. There is as of right now no apparent reason for the shootings other than the boys have told schoolmates in the past that they felt they did not fit in. Their gang reportedly disliked minorities and athletes. Witnesses said the boys laughed as they methodically moved through the school shooting people at random.

American President Bill Clinton went on television yesterday to express his condolences to the families and friends of the victims. He said the challenge facing America is to teach its young people to resolve their problems with \"words not weapons.\" Clinton said he would have more to say on the issue of violence in the school system later this week. The rampage began just before noon as the two boys in black trench coats and black masks walked into the school, armed with guns and explosives. One witness said they seemed to be shooting at random and shouting that they were seeking \"revenge.\" For hours, students inside the building hid in fear for their lives. Some students took cover the school's choir room and were able to stay in touch with police by using their cell phones.

The town of Saint Anthony staged a referendum during the last 10 days but with a different result than that of half a century ago. This time the \"No\" side won by a slim margin. Of the 934 people who cast ballots, 53 per cent opposed joining Canada. In fact, the referendum also mirrors history. The first time Newfoundlanders voted in 1948 they rejected union with Canada. It was only in the second vote that Newfoundlanders said \"yes\". It's a result many Newfoundlanders and their politicians have wondered about over the years. Where would Newfoundland be today if the referendum results had been reversed and 52 per cent of voters chose independence? Newfoundlander John Crosbie was a minister in the Conservative government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.  He thinks the province may have been all right on its own. \"It is highly likely we would have survived,\" Crosbie said. \"It would have been a lot more work and more difficult, but it wouldn't have been necessarily a disaster had we continued as an independent dominion.\" But Mr. Crosbie does recognize the benefits of the union. \"Our quality of life is better here today because people have a basic level of security,\" he says. Mr. Crosbie says a number of federal government programs like unemployment insurance and aid packages to fishers who are out of work are just a few of the reasons Newfoundlanders should count their blessings. Newfoundland was granted full British colonial status in the early 19th century. The Royal Navy began escorting ships to the Grand Banks fishing grounds for the summer fishing season and soon developed seasonal communities along the coast. As permanent settlements formed, civil governors replaced fishing admirals and colonial political institutions were set up. Newfoundland s first popularly elected legislative assembly convened in Saint John s in 1832. In the decades that followed, the colony was run by representative government, and later, responsible government in 1855. The population was also strongly divided by religion -- half were Protestant, half Roman Catholic. By the turn of the century, Newfoundland was a self-governing colony that played a small role in international affairs. But life in small communities dotting the coast -- called outports -- was rough. Poverty, starvation and disease were rampant. By the end of the Second World War, union with Canada was once again being mentioned. Newfoundlanders were swept up in a passionate debate between a pro-union movement called the Confederates and an anti-union movement that wanted Newfoundland to have what was called \"responsible government\", that is, to remain independent from Canada. A vote was held on July 22, 1948. On the morning of July 23, 1948, Newfoundlanders awoke to hear that the Confederates had won. It was a tight race: the pro-confederates received 52.3 per cent of the vote with responsible government getting 47.7 per cent. Newfoundland was on its way to becoming Canada s tenth province. A gala concert caps Newfoundland's celebrations this evening with guests on both sides of the unity debate. Both Prime Minister Jean Chretien and Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard will join in the festivities of the nationally televised event."}]}, {"title": "Canada's Newest Judge", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "When will Judge Arbour start her new job on Canada's Supreme Court?", "id": "1999-W24-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who is Judge Arbour replacing in her new job?", "id": "1999-W24-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Before getting her new position, what was Judge Arbour's job?", "id": "1999-W24-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where did Judge Arbour get her law degree?", "id": "1999-W24-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who says Louise Arbour is \"a down-to-earth individual\"?", "id": "1999-W24-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What was the president of Yugoslavia indicted for?", "id": "1999-W24-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why was the announcement about Judge Arbour not made until NATO and Yugoslavia signed an agreement?", "id": "1999-W24-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "The woman who charged Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for war crimes has been appointed to Canada's Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is Canada's highest court. Louise Arbour will become the high court's third female justice when she begins her new job in September. Justice Minister Anne McLellan says the 52-year-old Arbour is perfect for the job and will replace retired justice Peter Cory quite nicely. Ms. McLellan says Judge Arbour will make sure the tribunal continues to pursue its cases against Milosevic and his fellow accused ministers. She says Judge Arbour's work prosecuting war crimes would enhance the Supreme Court, describing her as \"a woman who has dealt with some of the most difficult and challenging issues of our modern time. \"I think it is unquestioned that she will make a singular contribution to the highest court in the land.\" Judge Arbour's last major act as chief prosecutor was to indict Slobodan Milosevic for crimes against humanity two weeks ago -- the first time an international court has charged a sitting head of state with war crimes. She held the Yugoslav President personally responsible, along with four of his aides, for the horrors in Kosovo and the brutal purge of ethnic Albanians. It appears to be no coincidence that Ms. McLellan announced the appointment the day after NATO and Yugoslav generals signed a detailed military agreement on the withdrawal of Yugoslav and Serb forces from Kosovo. The government was very aware of how tricky it would be to take her away from her high-profile assignment of prosecuting Milosevic. Judge Arbour will not start work until September 15th. Judge Arbour is seen as having a sound knowledge of the law, coupled with an understanding of the practical implications that judgments have on people. Her multitude of friends describe her as legally brilliant, charming, and possessed of a common touch. \"Louise Arbour is a down-to-earth individual, who understands the needs of the ordinary person,\" says lawyer Earl Levy. Judge Arbour graduated from the University of Montreal with a law degree in 1970. In 1995, she headed an inquiry into the mistreatment of women in the Prison for Women in Kingston, Ontario.

The build-up of these chemicals makes eating Arctic fish and game a frightening and tricky business. The issue came to a head recently as both Canadian aboriginal and federal delegates attended a United Nations conference in Africa. They were seeking to bring attention to the negative effects of globally-produced chemical contaminants on the Arctic food chain. Carole Mills works with the problem daily, both in the contaminants division of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, and as a representative of the Canadian Arctic Indigenous Peoples Against POPs. \"POPS\" are persistent organic pollutants. \"The contamination of animals is confusing and sometimes even alarming, and even my own family members have sometimes stopped eating fish until I could talk to them and explain that the contaminants do concentrate in specific parts, so you don't have to stop eating the animals,\" she says. Ms. Mills says the concentration of chemical pollutants in marine Mammals increases as its position in the food chain gets higher. So micro-organisms carry little contamination; the fish that eat them carry slightly more, and the build-up continues through the chain to include predatory fish, seals, walruses, whales and polar bears and, lastly, humans. Ms. Mills says land-based animals like caribou are very clean. She says it is only the organs and fat of marine mammals that concerned individuals might want to avoid. She says concentrations are bound to be higher in muktuk, a dish made from seal, walrus or whale fat. Ultimately, Ms. Mills stresses a calm, sensible approach. That advice is seconded by Eric Loring, environmental wildlife coordinator with the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada. The Tapirisat is an organization that represents Canadian Inuit. \"We don't really know what the effects of the contamination are, and that's the problem,\" Loring said Thursday. Both Mills and Loring stressed the importance of not scaring people away from country food, while they continue their research and lobbying efforts to turn off the global \"chemical tap.\" \"I would say right now it's more of a health risk to not eat country food than to eat it,\" Loring said, \"because it contains vitamins and nutrients that they would never find in store-bought food.\" Both Mills, who is of Gwich'in descent, and Loring stressed the importance of country food to aboriginal peoples' sense of identity. \"It's important as a cultural activity -- so much so that at the ITC office every day for lunch we have raw seal, fish, caribou or berries,\" said Loring. \"We have access to the same great supermarkets as anyone else in Ottawa, but this is our healthy choice.\" source: Northern News Service"}]}, {"title": "A Looming Battle in Kosovo", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What do the nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization want to stop the Yugoslavians from doing?", "id": "1999-W13-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What are the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo pushing for?", "id": "1999-W13-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How old are the roots of the conflict between Kosovo and Serbia?", "id": "1999-W13-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When did the Serbs lose a key battle against the forces of the invading Ottoman Empire in Kosovo?", "id": "1999-W13-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where is the capital of Kosovo?", "id": "1999-W13-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who is Slobodan Milosevic?", "id": "1999-W13-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How has Milosevic described the problems in Kosovo?", "id": "1999-W13-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What does Milosevic refuse to do?", "id": "1999-W13-3-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What do Yugoslav officials feel they can do in a war against NATO?", "id": "1999-W13-3-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How many Canadian Forces personnel are based in Aviano, Italy?", "id": "1999-W13-3-11", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "Air-raid warning sirens sounded in the Kosovo capital of Pristina this morning. Yugoslavia is bracing for air strikes by NATO forces. Reporters say the siren lasted about 90 seconds. There was a brief pause before the siren sounded again. Yugoslav authorities have declared a state of emergency. They are getting ready for war. They've shut down the country's main independent radio station and they're preparing shelters for the civilian population. This is happening because the coalition of countries that are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organizatoin (NATO) want to stop the Yugoslavians from invading the neighbouring region of Kosovo. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which is one of the republics that make up Yugoslavia. Ninety per cent of Kosovo's population are ethnic Albanians, who have been pushing for independence from Serbia. Brigadier-General Michel Maisonneuve is the senior Canadian Forces officer who has been serving with NATO. He adds that \"Kosovo is a beautiful part of Yugoslavia. It is relatively flat, with mountains surrounding it, as well as a spine that runs up the middle. The province is in large majority ethnic Albanian, with many other minorities, including Serbs, gypsies, Turks, etc. The people are hospitable and hardy.\" The conflict that is being played out today has roots that go back hundreds and hundreds of years. In 1389, Serbs lost a key battle against the forces of the invading Ottoman Empire on the fields of Kosovo. The defeat marks the beginning of the end of Serbia's Medieval Empire. Kosovo became part of the Ottoman Empire. In the following centuries that battle become the key event in Serbian and Albanian national history. Over the last decade there have been many attempts at a peaceful settlement. Representatives of the NATO countries have tried to negotiate with the government of Yugoslavia. Those negotions failed earlier this week. NATO says that bombing Yugoslavia is the only way to get them to stop their assault on Kosovo. The question is no longer if, but when, NATO will begin bombing. NATO Secretary General Javier Solana assured Yugoslovia's neighbours today that the alliance would protect them in the event of attacks by Yugoslavia. Yugoslav officials say they might not be able to win a war against NATO, but they feel they can inflict serious damage. NATO military planners aren't taking the threats lightly. Few people believe that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is ready to give in. He opposes outside interference in Kosovo. The Yugoslav leader insists the problems in Kosovo are an internal Yugoslav matter. He refuses to allow any outside force into Kosovo to monitor any peace agreement. If NATO strikes proceed, Canadians will be involved. There are about 130 Canadian Forces personnel and six CF-18 fighter aircraft based in Aviano, Italy who will likely participate."}]}, {"title": "A Sad Groundhog Day", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who is Wiarton Willie?", "id": "1999-W06-2-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What happened to him two days before Groundhog day?", "id": "1999-W06-2-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who took care of Willie?", "id": "1999-W06-2-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How old was Willie when he died?", "id": "1999-W06-2-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When will he be buried?", "id": "1999-W06-2-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where did Willie live?", "id": "1999-W06-2-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who claims to have received a message from Willie's spirit?", "id": "1999-W06-2-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "Wiarton Willie, the famous Canadian groundhog who predicted the arrival of spring, died in his sleep of natural causes on Sunday, two days before Groundhog's Day.

Mosasaurs have been found across the world from Sweden to New Zealand, but never in Antarctica. The mosasaur discovery shows the Antarctic was once much warmer than it is now.

Camille Laurin was 76. He had been ill with cancer. Dr. Laurin was a psychiatrist who became active in Quebec politics during the 1960's. He was first elected to the Quebec National Assembly, Quebec's legislative assembly,  in 1970. Dr. Camille Laurin once described his beloved language law as the \"re-conquest\" of Quebec. He was referring to the history of Quebec. During the 18th and 19th century, French-speaking Quebecers were often ruled by governments that were controlled by England. Many French-speaking Quebecers considered themselves to have been conquered by \"les anglais\" - the English. By the 1950's French-speaking Quebecers were increasingly convinced that the only way to stand up for their own rights was for Quebec to become an independent country, separate from Canada. Camille Laurin was among them. Bill 101 required signs in Quebec to be in French. Before Bill 101 became law many signs in Quebec were only in English, even though the majority of the population is French speaking. Bill 101 also required the children of immigrants to go to French schools. Many French-speaking Quebecers were worried that immigrants would choose English schools for their children. That would mean that the French language would slowly die away. Many English-speaking Quebecers did not like Bill 101 because they felt it took away their freedom to put up English signs. They also disagreed with the government telling immigrants which schools they must attend. Bill 101 came into effect in 1977. For many years it was big news in Quebec as there were many demonstrations - both from people who supported the bill and from those who hated it. One thing was never in question, however, was Dr. Laurin's passionate love of Quebec. \"Dr. Laurin was a pioneer, a builder, a man of conviction, determined,\" says Francois Gendron, chairman of the Parti Quebecois caucus in the legislature. Liberal opposition Leader Jean Charest praised his protection of the French language. \"He was a man who was devoted to the interests of Quebec  and in that sense today is a day of sadness for us.\" To some in the English-language community, Laurin symbolized francophones who wanted to crush the anglophone minority. William Johnson, a hardline English-rights activist, said he was personally saddened by the death of his ideological opponent. \"He was very cultivated man, with a seductive charm.\" But the president of the Alliance Quebec English-rights lobby condemned Laurin's masterwork as an attempt to \"wipe out bilingualism\" in Canada. Bill 101 is credited by Quebec nationalists as helping preserve the French language in a sea of English in North America. Dr. Laurin made no apologies for the law's toughness, saying the law simply reflected Quebec's demographic reality. Although it meant a lower profile for anglophones and less clout after years of predominance, Laurin said it took away no basic rights and recognized their institutions, schools and media."}]}, {"title": "Hockey Star's Arts Donation Sours", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How much does Alexi Yashin earn as a hockey player?", "id": "1999-W04-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who does Alexi Yashin play for?", "id": "1999-W04-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How much money did Alexi Yashin actually donate to the National Arts Centre?", "id": "1999-W04-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why do people go to the National Arts Centre?", "id": "1999-W04-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How would Alexi's parents have benefited from his donation to the National Arts Centre?", "id": "1999-W04-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where did reporters question Alexi Yashin?", "id": "1999-W04-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "Ever heard the expression \"don't look a gift horse in the mouth?\" It means not to be too critical if you get something for free. Well, that is exactly what the federal government is doing concerning a million dollar gift to the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, Ontario.  And it appears the government does not like what it has found. To continue the metaphor, it look like this horse has some major dental problems. The government has been looking at a charitable donation by Ottawa Senators hockey star Alexi Yashin. Earlier this year he promised to give one million dollars to the National Arts Centre, a concert hall where people go to see plays and dance and to hear live music. Many Canadians were delighted to see that Alexi Yashin was donating so much money. Mr. Yashin makes a salary of more than three million dollars a season. It is very expensive to put on live performances and the National Arts Centre has recently had to raise ticket prices and cut back on performances because of a lack of funds. It was the most famous donation ever to the National Arts Centre. Mr. Yashin's popularity soared. But then this week Mr. Yashin's donation turned sour. After giving the Centre $200,000 Alexi Yashin made an about face. He decided not to give the other $800,000 he had promised. He says his decision was for personal reasons. But it now looks like Alexi Yashin was not really being honest. It seems he actually changed his mind because federal Auditor General Denis Desautels told him he was trying to break the law. Mr. Yashin originally announced he was a lover of the arts. He said that as a well paid hockey player he wanted to help the National Arts Centre put on new performances. But behind the scenes his plan was not to give the Arts Centre one million dollars. Instead, in a secret agreement, the National Arts Centre would have hired Mr. Yashin's parents at $85,000 a year. They would have been paid out of Alexi Yashin's yearly $200,000 donation. What's more, his parents would not have to actually work. This was a way for Alexi Yashin to give money to his parents while illegally saving thousands of dollars in taxes. As well, a lawyer working for Mr. Yashin was to get $15,000 out of the remaining $115,000. So in fact the million dollar donation would really only be half of that. It would have been a great public relations victory. Mr. Yashin would look like he was being very generous. But behind the scenes he was really much less so. Yesterday evening the Ottawa Senators were playing in Boston. After the game reporters went to the locker room to ask Alexi Yashin what was going on. But he refused to talk to reporters about his \"personal reasons\" for cancelling his donation. He said simply that \"I know I didn't do anything illegal. I know I didn't do anything wrong. I can't control what they say. It's a free country.\" He also said he wanted to focus on hockey and nothing else. The other players and coach of the Ottawa Senators would not comment either. They said it was Alexi's personal affair and not important to them. Many Ottawa-area hockey fans are deeply disappointed with what is going on. \"People here are puzzled. They feel let down,\" says Rick Soweita, who owns a sports bar. \"He benefited from the publicity and now he's got to own up.\""}]}, {"title": "Canadians Participate in Yugoslavian War", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where are the Canadian fighter bombers based?", "id": "1999-W13-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What is the goal of the NATO bombing in Yugoslavia?", "id": "1999-W13-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How many of the targets they were given did the Canadian fighter bombers hit?", "id": "1999-W13-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why did one pilot not launch his weapons?", "id": "1999-W13-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who has been protesting the bombing in Yugoslavia?", "id": "1999-W13-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When is a demonstration planned for the front of the House of Commons?", "id": "1999-W13-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who is Art Eggleton?", "id": "1999-W13-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "Canadian bombs hit their targets during NATO's initial attacks on war-torn Yugoslavia, officials announced yesterday.

Everybody's a little expectant when they're gone.\" In Ottawa, Ontario, officials gave the first descriptions of Canada's role in Wednesday's lead wave. \"There were four aircraft and they had four separate targets,\" said lieutenant-general Ray Henault, deputy chief of defence staff. \"Three of the four targets assigned to our aircraft were hit. \"One of the pilots was unable to positively identify the target that he had been assigned and, as a measure and a mark of excellent discipline, he didn't launch his weapons.\" There were no immediate damage estimates. Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy has said the goal is to force Yugoslavia to accept a peace agreement proposed by the United States. It would allow ethnic Albanians in Kosovo to govern themselves. That is what seems to lie at the heart of the conflict. The government of Yugoslavia -- which is mostly Serbian -- does not want to allow the region of Kosovo, where most of the residents are of Albanian heritage, to rule themselves. \"We are trying to deliver the message that military force against civilians is not acceptable,\" Mr. Axworthy said in Winnipeg, Manitoba. \"The targets are those that are military and every effort is being made to keep whatever other casualties to a minimum.\" \"We are trying to stop a humanitarian disaster,\" Defence Minister Art Eggleton told the House of Commons. \"We must, in fact, ensure that this genocide comes to an end.\" Yugoslavia is thought to have dangerous air defences, including surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft guns.

She's been too busy getting the new International Space Station ready. Though it was cold and noisy, space shuttle Discovery astronauts were overjoyed over the weekend when they swung open the hatches to the International Space Station. Shuttle commander Kent Rominger likened the visit to checking in to a \"fantastic hotel,\" with one major exception: \"Right now there's not a space toilet on board, so that makes living here permanently kind of tough.\" Astronaut Tamara Jernigan and Russian crewmate Valery Tokarev led the way inside the unfinished station yesterday evening. \"We are absolutely delighted to be aboard,\" Ms. Jernigan said as she and Mr. Tokarev floated aboard. \"Make yourself at home,\" Mission Control told the seven-member crew. But their welcome quickly gave way to work early today. Inside the Russian-built Zarya control module, Valery Tokarev and Canadian astronaut Julie Payette pulled up the floor and began changing electrical meters on batteries that aren't charging properly. Astronauts Rick Husband and Daniel Barry replaced two electronics boxes for a communication system inside the American Unity chamber, where it was a brisk 14 degrees. The system, which allows ground controllers to transmit and receive commands from the station, had been broken since mid-April but fired up quickly once the repairs were made. \"Your hard work has paid off!\" Mission Control radioed up. \"Well that's super news,\" Mr. Husband replied. Earlier, the crew installed insulation around some fans inside Zarya to reduce the noise level, which Mr. Barry said measured up to 67 decibels. Station officials hoped the mufflers would reduce the noise level to about 60 decibels -- about the same as an office environment. \"It is a little bit noisy in there.\" The National Aeronautics and Space Administration downplayed the multitude of problems coming so soon after the space station's launch. \"In high-tech like this, you're going to have that happen,\" Mission Control's Milt Heflin explains. The astronauts also began hauling supplies from the shuttle into the station. They have until Thursday to unload 1,636 kilograms of spare parts, computers, water and clothes for the first permanent residents, due to arrive next March."}]}, {"title": "Tibetan Flag Removed During Chinese Premier's Visit", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who was who was chanting \"Shame on China\" on Wednesday?", "id": "1999-W16-4-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who is the mayor of Saint John's?", "id": "1999-W16-4-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How long will the premier of China be in Canada?", "id": "1999-W16-4-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where was Zhu before he came to Canada?", "id": "1999-W16-4-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How did Zhu respond to questions about a prominent dissident?", "id": "1999-W16-4-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where did Premier Zhu go after meeting with Newfoundland's Premier Brian Tobin?", "id": "1999-W16-4-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What does the white cowboy hat symbolize in Calgary?", "id": "1999-W16-4-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "The mayor of Saint John's, Newfoundland lowered the flag of China's troubled Tibetan territory following reports that Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji wasn't amused. The Tibetan flag was hung on City Hall Flagpole before the Chinese Premier arrived. \"I was advised through contacts in the business community that if the flag was not lowered, Zhu would cancel his trip to Saint John's,\" said Mayor Andy Wells. \"It shows how insecure they must be that they'd be sensitive to a flag flying in a city of 150,000 people, 50,000 miles from China.\" Zhu's plane landed in a shroud of thick fog in Saint John's Wednesday night. It was the beginning of a six-day, six-city Canadian tour that will emphasize trade and environmental issues. The premier arrived in Canada after wrapping up a nine-day visit to the United States. China's record on human rights often dogged Zhu during the U.S. leg of his trip and is expected to follow him north. Zhu, accompanied by a delegation of about 150 people, was greeted by Newfoundland Premier Brian Tobin. About 120 Chinese , many of them school-age children or students at Memorial University, also turned out to wave Chinese and Canadian flags and shout greetings. A banner read \"Warmly welcome Premier Zhu Rongji to visit Canada.\" On Tuesday, Wells granted a local group permission to fly the Tibetan flag at City Hall for the duration of Mr. Zhu's visit as a show of protest against the country's human rights record. In Ottawa, Sean Rowan, a spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs, confirmed the Chinese delegation complained about the flying of the Tibetan flag. He said federal officials explained that Canada is a free country and that flying the flag was a decision of the City of Saint John's and in no way represented Ottawa's policy. Rowan said the Chinese concerns were passed on to provincial officials just the same. Wells said he will not present Zhu with the keys to the city, a tradition usually accorded visiting dignitaries. It's just one small protest to remind the Canadian government that not all Canadians support pandering to China for business contracts,\" said Wells, who is a member of Amnesty International. \"Some people believe that human rights is not just a western custom.\" He also said Calgary, Alberta Mayor Al Duerr's decision to present a white cowboy hat, Calgary's symbol of hospitality, to Zhu was \"shameful\" and \"unacceptable.\" Duerr shrugged off the criticism. \"It's easy to throw stones when you're sitting on a rock,\" he said, adding the white hat has nothing to do with politics. \"When the white hat becomes a political symbol, we will stop giving it out.\" Canadian activists, meanwhile, want Prime Minister Jean Chretien to speak out forcefully when the politically-powerful Zhu arrives in Ottawa, Ontario later today. James Pilgram of the Canada-Tibet Committee said flying the Tibetan flag in Saint John's was meant to be a peaceful sign of protest. After Tibet's failed 1959 uprising against the Chinese, the Dalai Lama and 120,000 followers fled their Himalayan homes for what has become a lifelong exile, mostly in India and Nepal. There are smaller Tibetan communities in Switzerland, the United States and Canada. China effectively annexed Tibet after the revolt and declared it a Chinese province. Several demonstrations cantering around the Tibet issue occurred during Zhu's U.S. visit. During a protest earlier Wednesday in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a flag-waving pro-Chinese demonstrator was knocked down after he got close to a group of about 100 pro-Tibet protesters who were chanting \"Shame on China.\" The protesters grabbed the flag from the man and burned it. Following a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Zhu responded to questions about a prominent dissident by saying human rights in China have improved. He acknowledged some shortcomings, however. \"We wish to establish a nation which is ruled in accordance with law,\" he said. \"As for any individual case, I don't think this is the appropriate time to go into details.\" Before leaving for Ottawa Thursday, Zhu met with Tobin and his cabinet. Zhu will also visit Toronto, Ontario; Victoria and Vancouver, British Columbia; and Calgary, Alberta."}]}, {"title": "Compensation Recommended for Doukhobors", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "When were the 170 children of the Sons of Freedom sect of the Doukhobor faith locked up in internment camp?", "id": "1999-W15-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where was the internment camp for the children located?", "id": "1999-W15-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What did ombudsman Dulcie McCallum's investigation into the treatment of the Doukhobor children find?", "id": "1999-W15-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What did the government force the children to build while they were interned in the camp?", "id": "1999-W15-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How often were the interned children allowed to visit with their parents?", "id": "1999-W15-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who is Ujjal Dosanjn?", "id": "1999-W15-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How have provincial officials responded to the ombudsman's report?", "id": "1999-W15-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "\"With Your shield of iron, protect me, O Lord, from bloody violence, from guns that kill, from the sabre's cutting blow, from swords of steel, from spears of war. Amen.\" -from a Doukhobor Prayer. British Columbia's ombudsman says the provincial government should apologize to and compensate the children of a controversial religious group who were locked up in an internment camp during the 1950s. An ombudsman is a person who is appointed by a government to investigate individuals' complaints against public authorities. Ombudsman Dulcie McCallum said an investigation found the 170 Doukhobor children were subjected to abuse and suffered \"loss of love, nurturing guidance and childhood\" while they were detained from 1953 to 1959. Children and their parents were members of the Sons of Freedom sect (group) of the Doukhobor faith. The sect strongly condemned private property and government control. They refused to send children to public schools. Provincial officials and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police held the truant children, many of whom spoke only Russian, at a former sanatorium - a hospital for people with tuberculosis - in New Denver, British Columbia, and forced them to attend local public schools. \"The children were caught in a situation not of their own making, nor within their control. They were caught in a web of conflicting values and political turmoil, involving their parents, religious leaders, police and the government,\" Ms. McCallum says in her report. The report said one example of the mistreatment was that children could only visit with their parents through a chain-link fence that the children themselves had been forced to construct. Here what some of the Doukhobors remember about the fence: And for some reason they put up this fence and once in two weeks you get to see your parents through a fence. I mean it was kind of degrading and, the thing is they even had us build the fence, you know. We were digging the holes for the fence. As a child you don't register the impact of it. Like, so they're doing something, they're building a fence. Didn't really question why, and then after, you know, slowly realized that well, wait a minute, we're imprisoning ourselves here. \"As a result of the maltreatment, those who were institutionalized in New Denver suffered harm and continue to suffer from the long-term ill-effects of this trauma,\" wrote Ms. McCallum. She says British Columbia should apologize to the religious sect and compensate the children. Provincial officials are studying the report and preparing a response. \"I want to acknowledge the feelings of the children who were separated from their families. This was a difficult time in British Columbia history,\" Attorney General Ujjal Dosanjn said yesterday."}]}, {"title": "Manitoba's No Kiss Zone", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why could students at Sisler High School be sent home or suspended for kissing?", "id": "2000-W06-4-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How are students at Sisler expected to treat each other, according to vice-principal Mike Kachmar?", "id": "2000-W06-4-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How did Kachmar describe school?", "id": "2000-W06-4-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why did Kachmar say he announced the ban on kissing?", "id": "2000-W06-4-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How far back in Western civilization are there references to kissing?", "id": "2000-W06-4-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who said he has never witnessed a problem in Sisler's hallways?", "id": "2000-W06-4-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where was kissing rarely practiced until the 20th century?", "id": "2000-W06-4-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When were medieval knights kissed?", "id": "2000-W06-4-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What is the \"holy kiss\" still a part of?", "id": "2000-W06-4-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "Students who lock lips in the hallways of Winnipeg's Sisler High School have been warned: if that friendly peck gets too passionate, they couldbe sent home or even suspended.

Kissing has a long history in Western civilization, with references dating back to the Old Testament. The ancient Greeks and Romans Early Christians greeted one another with a kiss, and this \"holy kiss\" is still a part of Roman Catholic rituals, such as when a bishop kisses a newly ordained priest. Medieval knights were kissed after being knighted, and the custom of kissing the bride remains almost universal in Western marriage ceremonies.

If the river does overflow, thousands of people would have to leave their homes and hundreds of square kilometres of farmland would be under water. Early settlers recognized the potential of the fertile soils along the Fraser for growing food. Busy harbours and towns grew nearby because of easy access to inland and marine transportation routes. This intensely used river is home to five deep-sea port facilities, a ferry terminal, several fishing boat basins and numerous marinas and floating homes. Over 200 companies, including several large woodand fish processing facilities operate on or near the Fraser. It also accommodates the largest log booming grounds in the world. The Fraser River is the largest river in British Columbia, over 1378 kilometres. long. Its headwaters are at Mount Robson in Jasper National Park. The drainage of the entire river basin (watershed) is nearly one quarter of a million square kilometers -- larger than the area of Great Britain. The flood of 1948, the last major flood in the Lower British Columbia Mainland, flooded the area with almost 8 metres of water, just 80 kilometres from Vancouver. The 1948 flood claimed 10 lives, destroyed or damaged 2,300 homes and caused $20 million in damage -- about $140 million in current dollars. Total water flows in the Fraser River this spring are predicted to reach 94 per cent of 1948 flood levels. Although some dikes have been improved, the potential for disaster lingers if further prevention measures aren't taken, provincial officials said yesterday. The worst flood in the area's history was in 1894, when water levels reached 7.92 metres. A federal-provincial Fraser River flood-control program has rebuilt about 250 kilometres of dikes to withhold water levels as high as those in the 1894 flood. But officials say an estimated 150 kilometres of dikes in the Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley could not hold back that much water. Should high-water levels persist for abut two weeks, the dikes would be at serious risk of becoming saturated and breaching (breaking), or allowing seepage to escape through the soil and bubble up around homes and buildings. \"This can be quite dangerous if not controlled,\" says Environment Ministry spokesman Neil Peters. \"There is always the possibility the dike could fail.\" Ultimately, the water levels depend on the weather. If the snow melts gradually, there would probably be high, but safe, water levels. A very rapid melt could result in major flooding. \"The worst-case scenario is a month of scorching weather,\" Peters said. \"We would approach 1948 or 1894 levels.\" River levels are unlikely to peak before mid-May at earliest, and the peak flows might not occur until late June. Even if 1894 river levels aren't reached this spring, it's just a matter of time before they are, Peters says. \"We know this flood will occur sooner or later.\""}]}, {"title": "Boy Can t Pick Treatment", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What kind of treatments do the doctors want to give thirteen-year-old Tyrell Dueck for his cancer?", "id": "1999-W12-4-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where was the court where the trial took place?", "id": "1999-W12-4-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where does Tyrell's father want him to go?", "id": "1999-W12-4-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How would Tyrell prefer to treat his medical condition?", "id": "1999-W12-4-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who does the boy need to speak to without his parents present, according to lawyers in the case?", "id": "1999-W12-4-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When will Tyrell likely die if he doesn't receive proper treatment?", "id": "1999-W12-4-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "A judge in Saskatchewan has ruled that a 13-year-old boy cannot make his own decisions about treatment for the cancer that is destroying his bones. Doctors say that Tyrell Dueck, 13, will die from cancer in less than a year if he doesn t have part of his thigh bone removed and undergo chemotherapy treatments. But the boy refuses to continue the treatment. Today, Judge A. R. Rothery ruled that Tyrell is influenced by his father, and cannot make an independent decision. The judge said the boy is misinformed, and that social services must now step in to help him. Experts testified in court in Saskatoon yesterday that Tyrell is capable of making a decision, but that his decision is based on misinformation from his father. Tyrell s father wants him to undergo alternative therapy at a clinic in Tijuana, Mexico. The treatment consists of herbal remedies, doses of vitamins and a special diet. Psychologist Jo Nanson said Tyrell believes the tumour on his thigh bone is not cancerous because his father told him so. He also believes that herbal and vitamin treatments at the Tijuana clinic will make him well again. Nanson said Tyrell s only source of information is his father, who won t permit his son to speak alone with a medical doctor. Nanson also said that Tyrell wouldn t think of disobeying his father. A psychiatrist who talked to Tyrell to find out what he knew about his condition told the court that the boy hasn t received enough medical information. In the end, lawyers on both sides agree Tyrell should have a chance to speak with his cancer doctor alone.

Last Thursday CBC4Kids explained why Saskatchewan Judge A. R. Rothery would not allow Tyrell to refuse cancer treatment. Justice Rothery said that it was in Tyrell's best interest to continue with chemotherapy even if he and his family were opposed. Tyrell was examined by doctors in Saskatoon on Friday. They were getting ready to follow the judge's orders and continue treating Tyrell. Instead the doctors discovered that cancer has spread from Tyrell's leg into his lungs. It has all but ended his chance of recovery. \"Tyrell's legal battles are over. The matter is most certainly in the hands of God, if it ever were in the hands of mortals,\" the Duecks' lawyer Owe Girths told a stunned crowd of supporters on Sunday. Doctors have told Tyrell they can do nothing more for him. He spent a quiet weekend at home as his family considered what to do now. \"He is suffering with some pain in his knee. The doctors have given him some pain control for that but he maintains the quiet confidence in his God that he has had since the beginning of this thing,\" Mr. Girths said. Tyrell first discovered a lump on his leg around his birthday, October 1, after he slipped in the shower. Bone cancer was diagnosed. He and his family fought to avoid standard cancer therapy, consisting of chemotherapy and at least the partial amputation of his leg. Chemotherapy consists of putting various chemicals into the body to destroy the cancer. The Dueck family are fundamentalist Christians and wanted to send the boy to Mexico for alternative treatment, which would include herbs and large doses of vitamins, and rely on the power of prayer. Saskatchewan's Social Services Department went to court twice to force the boy to submit to traditional treatment. Last week, a judge ordered Tyrell to resume treatment but the family planned to appeal. But none of that matters with the new diagnosis. Saskatchewan Social Services was to go to court this week to lift all the orders involving the boy's treatment. The boy's doctor has said only 10 per cent of patients survive with his form of cancer, a rare osteosarcoma, once it has moved into the lungs. Mr. Griffiths said Tyrell's parents Tim and Yvonne no longer harbour anger about being dragged through the courts while their son's illness worsened. \"There was perhaps momentary resentment but there is no longer any resentment on their part. They believe that this has all unfolded as God would have it unfold,\" says Mr. Griffiths. Other family members who heard yesterday's announcement weren't so sure. \"I think Tyrell would not be in the situation he is today if Social Services had not stepped in two months ago,\" said Kevin Hildebrandt, Tyrell's uncle."}]}, {"title": "Nature Causes Havoc", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Which U.S. states were hit by the numerous tornados?", "id": "1999-W19-2-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What is the recognizable shape of a tornado?", "id": "1999-W19-2-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who said 40 people were killed in Oklahoma alone?", "id": "1999-W19-2-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When did authorities discover the initial count of 10 deaths in Sedgwick County was wrong?", "id": "1999-W19-2-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where was Chad Harris when the tornado hit?", "id": "1999-W19-2-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What is the wind speed range of an F-4 tornado?", "id": "1999-W19-2-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How many F-5 tornados hit the United States each year on average?", "id": "1999-W19-2-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why is the scale of intensity for tornados called the Fujita scale?", "id": "1999-W19-2-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How do scientists rank tornados?", "id": "1999-W19-2-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "Devastating tornadoes too numerous to count roared across the American states of Oklahoma and Kansas late yesterday. At least 46 people were killed and hundreds were left injured and homeless. A tornado is an extremely violent windstorm that is usually created within a thunderstorm or hurricane. The recognizable shape of the tornado is the swirling funnel cloud that extends from the base of a storm cloud to the ground. The Oklahoma state medical examiner said 40 people were killed in Oklahoma alone in Monday's storms, the largest of which formed about 110 kilometres southwest of Oklahoma City - cutting a path at least a kilometre wide as it moved north and east. About 400 kilometres miles north, a tornado spawned by the same storm system tossed mobile homes like tin cans, damaged houses and killed at least five people in Wichita, Kansas and its suburb of Haysville. Hospitals reported treating more than 80 people. Fred Irvin of the Sedgwick County Emergency Preparedness Office said today that the initial count of 10 deaths proved wrong when authorities realized victims had been counted twice. But authorities still fear more dead will be found. \"It is worse than what you can see,\" says Bob Thompson, a battalion chief for the Sedgwick County Fire Department. \"We'll probably find more deaths.\" The storm system began in southwest Oklahoma and moved into the neighboring state of Kansas. It included several tornadoes, one of which was nearly two kilometres wide at times. Witnesses say the twister was like a huge white train that came crashing through their homes. Chad Harris was with seven people inside his mobile home in Haysville when it was flipped over and demolished. Two of his companions were critically injured. \"I have no trailer,\" Harris said. \"We all rolled in it. It was the worst experience in my life.\" The Oklahoma City twister is ranked as an F-4 tornado, the second-strongest classification. An F-4 tornado has a wind speed of 333-419 kilometres per hour. It can level well-constructed houses, structures with weak foundations can be blown off some distance, cars are thrown and objects like trees can become airborne like missiles. Scientists rank tornadoes on the Fujita scale of intensity, named after a University of Chicago researcher. On average, only one F-5 tornado hits the United States each year."}]}, {"title": "Winter's Going...

More than 76 centimetres of snow has fallen in Saint John's since the blizzard started yesterday afternoon. A couple of thousand kilometres west, it is a whole different story. When a sun-tanned movie-making team flew up to Calgary, Alberta, from Hollywood, California to film the movie \"Snow Day\", they thought the least they could expect from the Great White North was a little snow. They were wrong. Calgary didn't get a single snowflake in March so on Sunday, the crew filming the movie, which stars Chevy Chase, unloaded 450 dump truck loads of snow. They transformed a Calgary street into a wintry scene set in Syracuse, New York. They laid white tarps and carefully placed hay bales to boost the snow height, then added the transplanted snow. Set workers then methodically shoveled so it would look just right. The street was complete with snowed-in cars, phony icicles dangling from the eaves of neighbourhood homes and bits of white felt on some of the roofs. Sunday's snow was hauled from Canada Olympic Park in the city's west end, where the movie's creators had been making it artificially. Ironically, the crew had previously been filming in Edmonton, where there was lots of snow.

The scientists say the colour of the mammoth's hair is still present, as is the smell of the skin. This means the hair or skin may still contain the DNA needed for the cloning experiment.

Wang traces his personal journey through a collage of original artwork mixed with family and archival photographs.  It's a journey that begins with Wang as a loyal Communist, full of the political idealism common in China under the early years of leader Mao Tse Tung. It ends with him as an anti-government activist willing to risk his life to uphold the first stirrings of democracy. \"Sunrise over Tiananmen Square\" shows how the dream starts to fade during the Cultural Revolution in the '60s and '70s, when the Red Guards attack and destroy anything linked to the old Chinese culture. And how the dream is crushed when the tanks roll in Tiananmen Square. Wang fled China after the student uprising and now lives in Montreal, Quebec.

The 37-year-old Calgary native who now lives in Tempe, Arizona, is part owner of the NHL s Edmonton Oilers. He has a company that makes action figures, and says the timing of his announcement was tied to the yearly Toy Fair in New York. Mr. McFarlane, who paid $3,005,000 U.S. for home run ball no. 70, had not seen the ball until Monday, when he came to New York fresh from a stay at the Baltimore Orioles  fantasy camp in Florida. He now owns 9 historic baseballs. Yesterday they were displayed in front of him in nine cases atop nine columns - white and  grey for No. 70, black for the others - with four burgundy velvet ropes separating them from the crowd and five men in blue security uniforms standing to the side. He says he would like to allow the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York to show McGwire s 70th home run ball at times. He would make it available to charities to raise money, and would let individual major league teams display it. And what would he like in return? \"I d like to be able to take 20 swings in every major league ball park,\" he says. Mr. McFarlane, who owns autographs from Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, says purchasing the ball was cheaper than buying a sports team. In all, McFarlane bought nine home run balls hit by McGwire and Sammy Sosa, including McGwires, 63rd, 67th, 68th and 69th, and Sosa s 33rd (his record 20th in June), 61st and 66th.

They set off this week on foot and by camel on a grueling trek across the burning Arabian desert. When they were still in Canada, planning their trip, they expected they would feel lonely. But after two days into the 1,200 kilometre journey, the caravan has won celebrity status among the native Bedouin people and government officials of Oman. Some have excitedly tagged along, says expedition leader Jamie Clarke. Mr. Clarke is making the trek with his older brother Leigh and their friend Bruce Kirby. They have hired three  guides. They are now in the Omani city of Solalah on the Arabian Sea. The group was forced to return briefly to replace some broken equipment, notably camel saddles, 40 kilometres into the odyssey. The adventurers expect to travel for up to 55 days through the scorching heat and towering dunes of Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. They are attempting to become the first Westerners in more than 50 years to cross the Empty Quarter of Arabia, the world's largest sand desert. Mr. Clarke has adventure in his blood. He scaled Mount Everest in the Himalayas in 1997. Now he and his companions are following a famous route taken by British adventurer Sir Wilfred Thesiger in 1947. They are journeying through the harsh and mostly uninhabited desert wearing the clothes and eating the food that is traditional for the nomadic Bedouin people. \"It's quite an event here to have us crossing the desert in such a traditional fashion and in the footsteps of Thesiger,\" Mr. Clarke says. \"So, our team can be anywhere from our six normal members on up to quadruple that size at night when people walk into camp or walk along with us to cheer us on.\" The site of the expedition's camp Wednesday was the Ayoon pools, north of Solalah, where temperatures during the day rise to 45 degrees Celsius  and fall at night to as low as 3 degrees Celsius. The start of the trip was delayed because of technical problems with communications equipment for use in emergencies and because of stomach problems after Clarke had his first taste of the Bedouin delicacy of goat brains. \"When the Bedouin cook, they are accustomed to using all of the animal. Every edible piece of the creature is in the pot, among them are some of the unsavory stuff like brains,\" Mr. Clarke says. \"I'm keen to try everything and sometimes it just doesn't agree. A little nausea, throwing up and diarrhea shouldn't hold somebody back.\" Mr. Clarke and his companions met with Mr. Thesiger, who is now 88, in London, England on their way to the Middle East from Canada. Mr. Thesiger's book Arabian Sands told the story of his 1947 trek. Among Mr. Thesiger's words of advice for the trio was to take great care of the camels because their lives depend on the very stubborn animals as transportation for themselves and their provisions. \"I don't think we really understood the magnitude of that statement, which is so simple and obvious. Yet in the first two weeks of our training here and the first two days of our journey, it's incredible how powerful that statement is,\" Mr. Clarke says. From Solalah, the route will take the group through Saudi Arabia and the trek will finish in Abu Dhabi. Along the way the party must cross the Uruq al Shaiba range of mountainous dunes, pass by the quicksand of Umm al Samim (Mother of Poison) and hike across a 185-mile stretch that has no water supply."}]}, {"title": "Melissa Virus Travels the Net", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How does the virus trick people into thinking they've received an e-mail from a person they know?", "id": "1999-W14-1-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why does the virus have the potential to clog e-mail servers?", "id": "1999-W14-1-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What three companies have had files affected by the virus?", "id": "1999-W14-1-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who has a Computer Emergency Response Team?", "id": "1999-W14-1-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who is Ms. Fithen?", "id": "1999-W14-1-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When did Carnagie Mellon learn of the virus?", "id": "1999-W14-1-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What do \"patches\" from antivirus software makers do?", "id": "1999-W14-1-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What can you do to protect yourself against \"Melissa\" and similar viruses?", "id": "1999-W14-1-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "Computer security experts are warning computer users around the world to be on guard today for \"important\" e-mail messages that carry a damaging computer virus.

Users may think they are receiving e-mail from a friend because the virus takes real addresses out of a users own address books. Over the weekend, businesses and governments around the world were contacting experts to see if Melissa can be stopped. One team of virus experts is at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The university has a \"Computer Emergency Response Team.\"  Katherine Fithen is with the team. She says the Melissa e-mail should be considered a potential security breach. \"It's safe to say we're bracing ourselves,\" she says. The Melissa virus spreads via Microsoft's widely used Word 97 and Word 2000 documents, which can be attached to e-mail messages, as well as Microsoft's Outlook and Outlook Express e-mail program. If a computer user opens the infected Word document, the virus propagates itself by reading the user's e-mail address book and sends an infected message to the first 50 entries. People cannot get the virus by merely opening up a message, only by opening the attached document. REMEMBER, NEVER OPEN A DOCUMENT ATTACHMENT FROM SOMEONE YOU DON'T KNOW. And now in this case, you can't even trust all the documents you receive from people you do know! Use common sense, and always be careful of anything that you receive via e-mail.

Measles is on track to being eliminated throughout North and South America by the turn of the millennium. At least that's the opinion of a number of health experts. Last year Canada had only 12 cases of measles, down from about 2,500 in 1995. \"It has been a surprise to me that measles has disappeared as quickly as it did,\" says Donald Henderson of the Pan American Health Organization. Most children who get measles will have a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, and watery eyes. These symptoms last for 1 or 2 weeks. But measles also causes ear infections in nearly 1 out of every 10 children who get it. As many as 1 out of 20 children with measles gets pneumonia. And about 1 child in every 1,000 who get measles will get encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain that can lead to convulsions, and can leave the child deaf or mentally disabled. For every 1,000 children who get measles, 1 or 2 will die from it. Measles can also make a pregnant woman have a miscarriage or give birth prematurely. Anti-measles immunization began in Canada in 1957. Before that virtually every child went through a bout with the disease. But the single-dose vaccine was not fully effective. In August 1995 an advisory committee recommended that all children be given a second dose of vaccine. The new policy was adopted in all provinces and territories. Rubella, commonly referred to as German measles, is a different disease with similar symptoms. It remains a problem and is one of the next targets for elimination. Measles is the latest in a string of successes for childhood vaccination programs, but experts fear they could be undermined by growing public suspicion about the risks and side-effects of immunization. Last year a group of Manitoba parents went to court in an effort to block a program to immunize Grade Four students against Hepatitis B. They lost their court case, but many parents chose not to have their children vaccinated, says Robert Pless of the federal Laboratory Centre for Disease Control."}]}, {"title": "Will Quebec's Nurses Go to Jail?", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard's special legislation intended to do?", "id": "1999-W27-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Under Bouchard's legislation, what could be imposed on the leaders of the nurses' union if they do not call off the strike immediately?", "id": "1999-W27-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where are nurses demonstrating?", "id": "1999-W27-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who is Michele Boisclair?", "id": "1999-W27-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why is Premier Bouchard reluctant to give the nurses more money?", "id": "1999-W27-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What are many drivers doing to show their support for the nurses on strike?", "id": "1999-W27-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who else has threatened to strike?", "id": "1999-W27-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When will the hospital pharmacists leave their jobs if the situation does not improve?", "id": "1999-W27-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How will some Quebec doctors respond unless the Premier comes up with more money for health care", "id": "1999-W27-5-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "The president of the Quebec Federation of Nurses says she will not obey back-to-work legislation that Premier Lucien Bouchard is expected to introduce later today.

The legislation could impose jail sentences on the leaders of the nurses' union if they do not call off the strike immediately. Quebec Federation of Nurses Vice-President Michele Boisclair has said that the Executive of the Federation is prepared to go to jail if that's what it takes. Ms. Boisclair told the Montreal Gazette, \"When you see nurses are willing to go that far, it shows how bad it is in the healthcare system.\" Nurses are now demonstrating on the sidewalks outside all Quebec hospitals. Public opinion seems to be on their side. Many drivers are honking their horns to show their support. In restaurants and on the street conversations are about the strike and how nurses deserve to be paid more money. Quebec nurses make between $32,000 and $44,000 a year. They are the lowest-paid nurses in Canada. Premier Bouchard is reluctant to give the nurses' more money because they are only the first of many labour organizations negotiating new contracts. If Bouchard agrees to give the nurses a raise, he will also have to give the other health care groups more money. Quebec ambulance technicians have also threatened to strike, and earlier this week, more than 90 per cent of hospital pharmacists submitted their resignations. The pharmacists will leave their jobs in 60 days if the situation does not improve. Some of Quebec's doctors are also taking a stand.

Try 40,000 years, to be precise. New research suggests that's how long people have inhabited the Yukon. That is tens of thousands of years earlier than originally thought. The previously accepted theory about the populating of North America was that the first inhabitants crossed a land bridge from Asia into what is now Alaska roughly 10,000 to 11,000 years ago, after the last Ice Age. Since the 1960s, scientists have pointed to \"Clovis points\" - 10,000 to 11,000-year-old stone tools found throughout much of unglaciated North America. But recently, scientists have suggested that the region known as Eastern Beringia, now in the eastern Yukon, could have been inhabited at least as far back as 25,000 years ago. Some researchers think habitation of the Americas dates back even further. \"My view is that there is no question that there were people in Eastern Beringia 40,000 years ago, and this view has to be taken into serious consideration if you want to discuss the peopling of the New World,\" says Jacques Cinq-Mars, an archeologist at the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Ottawa. At that time, during an ice age, much of North America sat under a kilometre-thick slab of glacial ice. But the Beringia area, which stretched from Siberia across Alaska and Yukon and into the Northwest Territories, remained ice-free. The latest evidence supporting the earlier dates was found in the Bluefish Caves, on the Bluefish River about 50 kilometres southeast of Old Crow. Archeologists found in the caves a mammoth bone that was probably flaked and shaped by human hands roughly 23,500 years ago. The caves also contained hundreds of bones from at least 18 species of migratory birds. The bones are anywhere from 10,000 to 25,000 years old. Many of the bird bones also show human-made cut marks. Mr. Cinq-Mars believes the caves were likely used by hunters over a period of roughly 15,000 years. The Bluefish Caves were re-discovered by Mr. Cinq-Mars in 1975. He led a research team that excavated the caves 1978 and 1987. The team's findings are showcased at the Beringia Interpretive Centre on the Alaska Highway. Heather Pringle is the author of In Search of Ancient North America, part of which is about the Bluefish Caves in northern Yukon. She says that \"most people still think of archeologists as wild guys in jungles looking for priceless artifacts to go in a museum. It seems to me archeology is much more about uncovering the lives of ancient people.\""}]}, {"title": "Uniforms and Strict Rules for Ontario Schools?", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who plans to institute a common code of conduct for students?", "id": "1999-W06-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How many students would the code affect?", "id": "1999-W06-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Under the code, what could happen to a student who swears at a teacher?", "id": "1999-W06-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When is one time that schools will phone parents of students?", "id": "1999-W06-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "According to Johnson, how might a student's sloppy clothing affect them?", "id": "1999-W06-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "Students in Ontario may be wearing uniforms next fall, or dressing for school in clothes that conform to a province-wide dress code. It's part of the Ontario government's plan to introduce a common code of conduct by next September for the province's 2.1 million students from kindergarten to Grade 12. Ontario's Education Minister Dave Johnson said students, parents and teachers will all be asked to discuss their opinions about uniforms before any final decisions are made. \"Short of a common uniform, there may be a style of dress that may be appropriate within a school,\" Johnson said on Tuesday. \"There are many people in the province who feel that uniforms add a tone of authority and discipline to a school and make for a better learning environment.\" The common code of conduct has started with a new safety policy that requires schools to phone parents to find out why absent students are missing. The code would also deal with acceptable language and set out the punishment for students who smoke, destroy property, steal, distribute hate material or carry a weapon. These are still up for debate. Johnson believes stricter discipline at schools will produce students with better grades and young adults with responsible attitudes. \"If students are dressed in a sloppy manner, that kind of habit and dress may flow over into their learning habits and make it difficult to conduct proper teaching,\" he said. Ontario Premier Mike Harris, 54, believes the province's kids are not what they used to be. He said he remembers the times depicted in the 1950s TV sitcom, Leave it to Beaver. Harris, a former teacher and parent to two young boys, said students need to learn some respect. \"They need to know what the line is,\" he said Tuesday. \"What's acceptable and what isn't and that there are consequences for going over that line.\" Swearing at a teacher, for example, might mean suspension, Harris said. For violence, the punishment could be expulsion. Marshall Jarvis, head of the Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association, said schools already have policies in place to handle unruly students. \"The school is a microcosm of the society around it. There are students with serious concerns. However to paint a picture that that's a general trend across Ontario is not something that I've witnessed,\" he said."}]}, {"title": "A New Look at Marijuana", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is the scientific name for marijuana?", "id": "1999-W10-4-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What is the Health Department's study going to examine about marijuana?", "id": "1999-W10-4-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who has the Canadian Health Department consulted with about obtaining marijuana?", "id": "1999-W10-4-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why was Mark Crossley sentenced to house arrest?", "id": "1999-W10-4-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where has marijuana already been approved for medical use?", "id": "1999-W10-4-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How long does it take for delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol to be absorbed into the bloodstream when someone smokes marijuana?", "id": "1999-W10-4-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "The federal government has plans to take a new look at the use of marijuana for people who are suffering from painful diseases such as cancer, AIDS and multiple sclerosis. All use of marijuana is now illegal in Canada. But if a scientific study of the drug shows that it can help relieve pain in some people, it could be legalized for medical use only. Marijuana is the common name of Cannabis sativa, a plant which contains more than 400 chemicals. What is commonly referred to as marijuana (\"grass\", \"pot\", \"weed\") in North America is usually made up of crushed cannabis leaves, flowers, and often twigs. Health Minister Allan Rock announced yesterday that his department is putting together guidelines for a scientific look at marijuana. The study would examine how the drug should be administered, and how a safe supply could be distributed to patients. \"There are people who are dying,\" Mr. Rock said. \"They want access to something they believe will help with their symptoms. We want to help.\" The Health Department has already consulted with the Food and Drug Administration in the United States -- which is also planning similar trials -- about acquiring marijuana for the tests. Making marijuana available to patients by prescription will not mean changes to the criminal code. Marijuana could be administered under an existing section of the Food and Drug Act, which allows for special access to prohibited substances. The belief that marijuana eases pain in some patients has been growing -- although people continue to face criminal charges across Canada even when they claim to be using it for medical purposes. THC (delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol) is the main psychoactive part of marijuana. When marijuana is smoked, THC is absorbed from the lungs to the bloodstream within minutes. Mark Crossley is a 38-year-old Nova Scotia man with an inoperable brain tumour.  He was sentenced last week to four months of house arrest and 18 months probation for growing marijuana in his backyard. He said he received the sentence even after the court was told he smoked the drug to deal with the painful headaches and appetite loss caused by his cancer. His doctor approved. Mr. Rock said his announcement is not a step toward a widespread legalization of the drug. \"This has nothing to do with legalizing marijuana,\" he said. But he added, \"I think Canadians support on a compassionate basis, if someone is dying, access to a substance that could alleviate their suffering.\" An Edmonton doctor who specializes in pain management agrees with the federal government's move.  Doctor Helen Hays studied a patient who smoked marijuana to fight the symptoms of a painful muscle disorder. \"There was a tremendous improvement,\" she said. She also says that smoking marijuana brings its own side effects and doesn't work for everyone. \"We all need to know an awful lot more about it.\" Doctors can currently prescribe a synthetic form of marijuana, but it is expensive, and many patients complain that oral forms of the drug don't work as well as smoking it. Several American states have already approved the medical use of marijuana. It was taken to a vote in seven U.S. states and the District of Columbia. A similar bill was also recently presented in the British House of Commons in London."}]}, {"title": "Julie Blasts Off Safely", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How long has Julie Payette wanted to be an astronaut?", "id": "1999-W22-4-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When she was in school, what would Julie do instead of going to recess?", "id": "1999-W22-4-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How many languages does Julie speak?", "id": "1999-W22-4-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When was Julie selected to be an astronaut by the Canadian Space Agency?", "id": "1999-W22-4-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where will the space shuttle Discovery be taking Julie?", "id": "1999-W22-4-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What will Julie use to document the mission progress?", "id": "1999-W22-4-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who will be Julie work with to change solar batteries?", "id": "1999-W22-4-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who is Aline Chretien married to?", "id": "1999-W22-4-11", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When was the International Space Station launched?", "id": "1999-W22-4-12", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "This morning at 6:48 Eastern Daylight Time, Julie Payette's 25-year-old dream came true. She blasted off into space aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery. The 35-year-old Quebecer has wanted to go to space since she was 10. She had a poster of Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, on her bedroom wall. \"I was fascinated by those trips the astronauts made to the moon, by their space suits, by their experiences, the equipment they used -- especially the lunar module and the lunar vehicle,\" she says. \"I wanted to be like them. I wanted to be an astronaut.\" Believe it or not, at school Julie used to skip recess so she could do her homework. And she used to exercise so much she would make herself sick. \"I had trouble getting her to stop working,\" says Sister Yolande Perrault, who was her French teacher. \"I would tell her, 'Julie, take a break.'\" Now all that work has paid off. Along with being an astronaut, Julie is a computer engineer, can speak 5 languages (French, English, German, Spanish and Russian), has competed in triathalon races (swimming, running, and biking), is a deep-sea diver, and has a jet pilot's licence. Julie is also interested in the arts - she plays the piano and is a soprano singer. Julie's space dream finally began to come true last year when she was selected for mission STS-96, which was supposed to launch on May 20th, 1999. But fulfilment of her dream had to wait until today, after a hail storm damaged the insulation on the Discovery's fuel tanks a few days before the scheduled launch. Although she will not be the first Canadian woman in space, she will be the first Canadian astronaut to enter and work on the International Space Station platform, launched last year by the United States and Russia. Her tasks will include unloading and arranging the 2,200 kilograms of equipment being carried to the station for future astronauts; working the remote-control Canadarm while supervising crew members constructing parts of the station, and documenting the mission's progress with video cameras. Julie will also have to help change the 18 solar batteries on the station module Zarya. Each battery is roughly the size of a cellular phone. That task will be undertaken with Russian astronaut Valery Tokarev. To make sure the job is done correctly, Payette learned Russian so she could communicate with Tokarev. She has been training for the mission since 1992, when she was first selected to be an astronaut by the Canadian Space Agency. Prime Minister Jean Chretien paid tribute to the Montrealer as a credit to the space program and the country. \"I'm telling you she's creating a great impression in the land. She's very young, very articulate and perfectly bilingual and she's showing the Canadian colours with pride and dignity and we should pray for her that everything will be all right, and it will be,\" said Mr. Chretien Aline Chretien, the Prime Minister's wife, was invited by Julie Payette to watch the launch in Florida. Yesterday evening Aline Chretien told her husband that her friend was \"starting to have butterflies.\" \"I guess I would have a few, too, sitting on that much power,\" said the Prime Minister."}]}, {"title": "Canadians Triumph Over Harsh Desert", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who said Bedouin ways are \"a death in life.\"?", "id": "1999-W12-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How long did it take Jamie Clarke and his companions to travel 1,200 kilometers across the Arabian desert?", "id": "1999-W12-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What was one of the things that motivated Clarke during the journey?", "id": "1999-W12-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where did the team's journey begin?", "id": "1999-W12-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When did Clarke dream about the desert?", "id": "1999-W12-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How do camels like to be spoken to?", "id": "1999-W12-3-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "\"Bedouin ways are hard, even for those brought up in them and for strangers, terrible: a death in life.

Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) While adventurer Jamie Clarke was crossing the world s harshest desert, he often thought his 1997 trip up Mount Everest had been easier. \"I ll never cross the Rub al-Khaly again,\" said the adventurer from Calgary, Alberta of his 39-day trek across the Arabian desert. \"But I d climb Everest.\" Clarke spoke from the comfort of a hotel room in Abu Dhabi and recalled the desert s challenges: threatening quicksand, mountainous sand dunes and blazing heat. Halfway through the journey, Clarke thought his chances of completing the trek were slim. But he and his team fought frustration, thirst, sandstorms and a scorching sun to make the 1,200-km journey that took them from Oman, through Saudi Arabia and into the United Arab Emirates. Not only did the six-man, 12-camel team make it, they beat their own deadline by three days. \"We are tired, thirsty and hungry, but ecstatic to be here,\" Clarke said. Clarke and two other Calgary residents, his brother Leigh and friend Bruce Kirkby, set out Feb. 2 from Salalah, Oman, along with three Bedouin guides and their camels. On March 12, they reached Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. They became the first Westerners in more than fifty years to cross the severe Arabian desert. \"The first thing I did when I came to the hotel was open the tap and pour a glass of cold water,\" Clarke said. \"In the desert, you had to be really thirsty to drink water stored in goat skin.\" He described the stored water, which became contaminated with goat hair and fat, as tasting like \"watered chocolate milk.\" He marvels at how lucky we are to be able to drink from a tap. There are no permanent roads or settlements in the desert, which covers 300,000 square kilometres of southern Arabia. It has been a lure to adventurers since British traveller Wilfred Thesiger crossed it in 1947 and wrote about his journey. Daytime temperatures reached 49 degrees Celsius, with the sand even hotter: 80 degrees Celsius. At night, the temperature fell as low as nine degrees. \"Before the journey, for months, all I thought about was being in the desert. I dreamt about it,\" Clarke said. \"When I got there, I couldn t wait to finish.\" Clarke said his relationship with the camels left an lasting mark on him. \"The camel became part of me. I became part of the camel. Listening to it, feeling it, becomes an extension of you because your life depends on it.\" He added that \"you have to be nice to it, you have to talk softly and show your love\" or you ll be trying to work with a grumpy, screaming beast. The trek left the men with blistered skin, chapped lips and less weight. Each lost at least 11 pounds. Clarke and his team sent reports and photos about their trip by satellite phone to a Web site that drew more than three million visitors. \"The kids were a great motivation, I felt they were cheering us on. \"I wouldn't advise someone to go there for 40 days. Maybe three, four days tops.\""}]}, {"title": "Refugees Arrive in Nova Scotia", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where in Nova Scotia did the plane carrying Kosovo refugees land?", "id": "1999-W19-4-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How will many of the Kosovo refugees spend their time in Canada?", "id": "1999-W19-4-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When did Shamsay Amoosa flee his homeland of Kosovo?", "id": "1999-W19-4-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who was with Ahmet Konyoury on the plane to Canada?", "id": "1999-W19-4-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How many countries worldwide does the United Nations Security Council represent?", "id": "1999-W19-4-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "A second planeload of refugees from Kosovo landed in Canada early this morning. The 264 people are among the first of the 5,000 people of Albanian heritage from the southern Yugoslavian province of Kosovo who will be coming to Canada. The refugees have been living in tents in the Stenkovac refugee camp in Macedonia since they left Yugoslavia. The plane touched down at Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Greenwood, Nova Scotia, at 1 a.m. local time, 10 hours behind schedule. The tired Albanians put on smiles for Red Cross volunteers and military officials. They told waiting reporters they were grateful for the safety Canada provides, but it was clear many will spend their time in Canada dreaming of returning home. On hand to greet his countrymen was Burnaby, British Columbia resident Shamsay Amoosa. Mr. Amoosa fled his homeland six years ago - from a civil war that few outside the country then paid attention to. \"Canada is a good country,\" Amoosa told the refugees. \"You will be safe here until things are better at home and then we will help you go back if you want.\" Ahmet Konyoury, who was on the plane with his wife and youngest daughter, said he didn't want to leave Kosovo. Rather, he had no choice. \"People over there, like Serbian military, said 'You like NATO, go there,' 'You like Clinton, go there,'\" he told CBC News through a translator. The Konyourys were one of the lucky ones who made it to Canada. At the filthy and overcrowded camps on Wednesday, thousands of refugees waited anxiously to hear their names called for overbooked flights to Canada. Officials had overbooked the plane after some families changed their mind at the last minute and didn't show up for the first flight. But on Wednesday, almost all the families lined up for the flight -- plus some. That meant delays as officials tried to sort out who would go and who must stay. Like the Konyourys -- and the refugees who wait still -- each person, each family, has a story about their plight, and their hopes for the future. The United Nations says the Kosovo refugee crisis could grow by another half million. Here are the numbers so far: 17,000 refugees in Bosnia, 62,000 in Montenegro, 404,000 in Albania, and 211,000 in Macedonia. There seems to be some movement towards putting an end to the war in Yugoslavia. The world's major powers may be close to a diplomatic breakthrough to end the conflict. The Group of Eight nations, including Russia, the United States, and Canada, have agreed to a seven-point plan to find peace in Kosovo, including the basic terms of an international force to secure the return of refugees.

He was set free after relatives paid a $1,200 fine. Last fall Mexican prosecutors charged Pascal with stealing small clay figurines from the Palenque ruins. He was put in jail in January. A local judge found Hudon guilty of the theft charges. Under Mexican law, all pre-Hispanic artifacts are considered national treasures. \"He's very happy because he's returning to his country,\" his lawyer, Alphonso Herrera Gonzalez, said. \"He called me from a pay phone to say he was finally free,\" his mother, Jocelyne Dion, told the french language newspaper Le Journal de Montreal. \"He was shouting with joy.\" For the Mexican authorities, their fight to prevent the looting of Mexico's vast stash of historical treasures is far from resolved. \"Looting and the illegal export of archeological goods is fairly prevalent,\" says Joaquin Garcia, chairman of Mexico's archeology council. Mexico has about 200,000 archeological sites, and only about 150 are monitored constantly and open to the public, he said. \"It's quite difficult to take care of them. We depend much on the people who live near the sites.\" Although Mexico has had laws to prevent looting since the middle of the 19th century, Mexicans have become increasingly alarmed lately about losing their national heritage to looters, and have started to apply their laws with greater vigilance. Mr. Hudon was a prime example of the new get-tough attitude. The former college student was found carrying eight pieces of ceramics, which he said he found on a path in the bush near the Palenque historical site in southern Mexico. Mr. Hudon has said he had intended to hand over the pottery to authorities, but before he had a chance to do so, he was stopped by police. They searched him and charged him with illegally possessing artifacts. He was put in a federal prison in Tuxtla Gutierrez in Chiapas state in the south of Mexico at the beginning of January. At a trial in February, he was sentenced to a year in jail plus one month of labour, and told to pay $72,000 to the National Institute of History and Anthropology. His family and friends in Montreal protested, and Mr. Hudon went on a hunger strike. The Canadian embassy intervened, and Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy spoke publicly about the need to get the young man out of prison in Chiapas. Last month, Mr. Hudon appealed the case. He was allowed to give a new statement through a translator. The judge ruled that he was not legally obliged to pay $72,000 to the institute, and lowered the fine to $2,500. Artifacts, some dating back tens of thousands of years, are frequently stolen when sites are discovered by excavators or through small-scale looting, he said. There has been looting at only three major projects in the past 15 years -- projects run by foreign experts. All three were halted and many artifacts recovered. Small-scale looting, however, has landed between 40 and 50 people in jail every year. And Mr. Garcia is sure much theft goes undetected. Despite his serious troubles, Pascal has not lost the urge to travel. He told his mom that after he visits with his family back in Montreal, he wants to head out to British Columbia to work as a tree-planter.

Otherwise, they would to have had to wait several months for its Icelandic release. And as if shelling out up to $9 for a Star War's ticket isn't bad enough: How about $50 or more? It's what some scalpers are asking in Los Angeles, California. \"It's horrible,\" said Tom Sherak, who helps distribute the film. \"This is just what we didn't want.\" When tickets went on sale each customer was limited to 12 tickets, although there has been no formal way to stop scalpers from returning to snag more tickets.

The Alberta Teachers Association says it's frustrating to see the provincial government more preoccupied with tax cuts than education. Local union president Kurt Moench says funding needs to be provided for teacher salaries and student growth. Class size is the biggest stumbling block in the dispute between the board and the teachers' union. The teachers say that there are too many students in each class and that means students are not getting all of the help they need. The 6,600 teachers want the return of a ratio of one teacher for every 18.4 students. Alberta Premier Ralph Klein said even he expects teachers to walk off the job. \"I think there's going to be a strike -- I hope that there won't be,\" said Klein in Edmonton, the province's capitol city. The province's education minister has urged both sides to keep talking. While a strike will leave more than 95,000 students in academic limbo and parents scrambling to make alternate arrangements, Grade 12 diploma exams will go on. School board chair Teresa Woo-Paw has said the board can't afford to meet the teachers' demands.

Premier Harris says it was the hardest-fought campaign in recent memory. Yesterday the Conservatives won 59 seats in the Ontario legislature. That means representatives of their party won in 59 \"ridings\" -- small political regions across the province. The Liberals led by Dalton McGuinty got 35 seats, and the New Democratic Party under leader Howard Hampton took nine seats. In Ontario's new 103-seat legislature, the Tories needed 52 seats for a majority government -- a government where they control more than half the seats. They got 8 more than that. A majority government makes it much easier for the ruling party to make decisions, because they get more than half of the votes on any issue. The Premier says he will now push ahead with following through on his campaign promises. They included things like cutting taxes, testing teachers, and cracking down on panhandlers and squeegee kids. It's the first time in 32 years that any party has won two majority governments in a row in Ontario. \"Four years ago you sent me to do a job, you placed your faith in our team, in our plan, and we have done our very best to implement that plan and keep your faith,\" Premier Harris told cheering supporters in North Bay. \"There is a new pride in Ontario. Our economy is back on track... faith in our future has been restored.\" Premier Harris was attacked during the campaign as leading a mean-spirited government, and for being a man who refused to compromise. During the campaign, he was hounded by protesters at every appearance. Election day began with a controversy, as polls did not open on time in several ridings. Several returning officers (the people in charge of a polling station) called in sick. In some cases, ballot boxes did not arrive on time and in other cases, problems with the voters list caused long line-ups. The problems forced Ontario's chief elections officer, Warren Baillie, to keep some polls open until as late as 11:00 pm.

The government wants to put graphic pictures and warnings on all cigarette packages. Allan Rock said yesterday that he's convinced the labels will work. But many of the young smokers he's targeting aren't so sure. The warnings cover half of each side of a cigarette package. There are 16 messages and images, including pictures of diseased lungs. Teenage smokers at a high school in Ottawa say some of the warnings are funny, but others, like an image showing a mouth full of rotting teeth, are disturbing and may make them think twice. \"I have to say this one with the teeth is quite disgusting. And I'm sure it will discourage a few smokers from starting up anyway,\" said one of the teens. But a 17-year-old smoker said he knows all about the dangers of his habit and new warnings won't make him quit. \"If you smoke, you know what's going to happen to you. Just seeing it a warning label is going to gross you out every time you take a cigarette. It's not really going to stop you.\" But Rock believes the warnings will make a difference. He says his department has done extensive surveys and he thinks the labels will be effective. \"Our testing, our focus groups and our surveys demonstrated that the old style warnings are losing their force. It's important for us now to take fresh steps and that's what we're doing today.\" Anti-smoking organizations have applauded the strategy. The Non-Smokers Rights Association says the labels will give people a graphic reminder of the harmful effects of smoking a cigarette. But the plan has a very powerful enemy. The tobacco industry is considering whether it should take the government to court. The Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Association, which represents tobacco companies, says it would take two years and cost millions of dollars to change the packaging on Canadian cigarettes. Spokesman Rob Parker is convinced the warnings won't work. \"They're still doing the same old thing, yelling even louder at smokers to quit or non-smokers not to start.

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters had been trying to organize the workers for 16 months. Rejean Lavigne, head of the Teamsters local behind the campaign, said almost all of the original employees who signed union cards in 1997 had quit and the new ones, some as young as 16, didn't want a union. \"If we lose, well, we can't do anything more,\" Lavigne said before the vote was tallied. \"If the employees don't want us there, what are you going to do?\" A statement from McDonald's Quebec regional office welcomed the vote. \"We believe that giving all the employees in the outlet the opportunity to determine the outcome of this matter was the fairest and most responsible way to resolve the question of union representation,\" the statement said. The McDonald's in Squamish became the first unionized outlet among the chain's more than 15,000 outlets in North America when the Canadian Auto Workers made a breakthrough last August. Rejection of the union in Montreal was the second failure for the Teamsters against the chain. Last year, a franchise in suburban St-Hubert, Quebec shut down just as the union was about to be certified. The latest loss means an end to a campaign begun last year to unionize at least one McDonald's in every major city across Canada, which has so far cost the Teamsters about $100,000.

The kids are named Clint, Arnold and Danny. This first Canadian cloning could lead to breakthroughs in the treatment of injuries like broken limbs and torn human tissues. The company used the same technology invented by Scottish scientists to clone Dolly the sheep in 1997. Cloning is the first step in a process that could ultimately lead to the mass production of a material known as BioSteel. Biosteel is an artificial spider silk developed by Nexia Biotechnologies. Company president Jeffrey Turner says the silk can be used in tissue repair, neurosurgery and sutures, and to create artificial tendons and ligaments, among other uses. Nexia aims to extract the spider silk from goat's milk. While nobody has yet made a fabric from biosteel, Mr. Turner is convinced the protein can be turned into a supermaterial because of its natural role in the silk of a spider's web. \"When you think of what a web has to do, its extreme strength makes perfect sense,\" he says. The silken threads of the web must be nearly invisible to prey and yet be able to bring a fly to a screeching halt. Clint, Arnold and Danny were born in March. To clone the triplet goats, a nucleus with a mass of cells from a source goat was placed in a petri dish and cultured. One of these cells was then implanted into a mature, unfertilized egg. This replaced the egg's original DNA, which had been removed. This process was done three times, each time using the same source cells. The eggs were then placed into two recipient mothers, with one female carrying two eggs, and the other the third. Because cells were taken from the same source, the three kids have exactly the same genetic makeup. The potential to mass-produce BioSteel is a main reason the animals were cloned in the first place. Mr. Turner says that BioSteel is the strongest substance known to man, with a tensile strength of 300,000 pounds per square inch. BioSteel is an artificial spider silk that is environmentally friendly, extremely strong and light, and compatible with the human body, says Mr. Turner. The company hopes eventually to extract this spider silk from goat's milk. Turner said the company will soon clone a sheep with the spider-silk gene in its genetic makeup. In the past year, the company tried injecting a spider-silk gene directly into the goat. But that system wasn't efficient enough. It worked on only four goats in a hundred. The new method could have close to a 100-per-cent success rate. Next year the company will clone another goat that will carry the spider-silk gene in its chromosomes. The silk protein can be extracted from the goat when it starts to produce milk. Turner said Nexia will clone only about three or four goats with the spider-silk protein. They can then reproduce with normal goats, and their offspring will still have the spider-silk gene in their bodies. But Clint, Arnold and Danny aren't making everyone happy. Some animal-rights activists and ethicists oppose the concept of cloning living beings. Professor Margaret Somerville says she does not agree with cloning for the purposes of creating a superior race of animals -- such as faster race horses or stronger elephants.

Looking tired and anxious after days of travel, Sefa, his wife and four grown children greeted members of their extended family - many of whom they had never met - at the airport with shy smiles, hugs and kisses. Speaking through an interpreter, Sefa said he was happy to finally be in Winnipeg and offered his thanks to the Canadian people for opening their doors to him and his family. The six ethnic Albanian refugees - the first to make their way to Western Canada - will be staying with Sefa's brother Esat and his son Haki. \"This last month has been rough,\" Sefa said. \"We were not happy to leave our home, but we are glad to be here and safe.\" A month ago, Sefa, 59, and his family were given less than five minutes to leave their home in the town of Gjakov by Serb forces who ordered them out of Kosovo. The family took no clothes, mementos or household items with them and walked about seven kilometres to the Albanian border. While most of Sefa's family made the trip to the Albanian capital of Tirana safely, his youngest son, Orland, 23, never showed up. \"We don't know if he's alive or dead,\" Sefa said. Esat Sefa said he has been wanting to bring his family to Canada ever since fighting erupted in Kosovo. He said he often tried to send money and supplies to them but shipments were regularly intercepted by Serb forces who kept the money and goods for themselves. Sefa and his family will receive support from the federal government for up to two years, during which time they can apply to stay in Canada permanently. But Sefa - who recently retired from his job at a theatre after 45 years - said last night it may not take that long for him to decide where to make his new home. \"Maybe we stay here,\" he said as his wife gestured with a nod. Another 10 Albanian refugees will head north to Thompson, Manitoba today to be reunited with family members there. Ninety more refugees with relatives in Manitoba are expected to make their way to the province over the next month. At least 700 more ethnic Albanian refugees are expected in the coming weeks. Hundreds of thousands of refugees are now living in camps just outside of Yugoslavia. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees says those camps are almost full. Aid workers are doing their best to shepherd the refugees to camps that have space. Canada originally planned to take in 5,000 refugees and house them at Canadian Forces bases. But the UN decided it would be better to keep refugees closer to home to ease their return when the war ends. NEWS FLASH The federal government has reopened its plan to airlift 5,000 Kosovo Albanians to refuge in Canada. Canada put the airlift on hold three weeks ago when the UN decided it was better to keep ethnic Albanians driven from Kosovo by Serbian forces close to home. At that time, the UN figured it would be easier to resettle them when a peace deal is reached with Yugoslavia. Immigration Minister Lucienne Robillard says she was asked today to \"reactivate\" the plan by the United Nations agency responsible for refugees. And Ms. Robillard responded that Canada will do so. The minister says the refugees will begin arriving Monday. Ms. Robillard says 300 people a day will be airlifted to Canada for about two weeks."}]}, {"title": "Canadian Basketball Superstar", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What team did Babe play for?", "id": "1999-W03-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What position did Babe play?", "id": "1999-W03-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How tall was Babe?", "id": "1999-W03-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How much was Babe paid to play basketball?", "id": "1999-W03-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How many games did the Edmonton Grads win?", "id": "1999-W03-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When did Babe play for \"the finest basketball team that ever stepped out on a floor\"?", "id": "1999-W03-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why did Babe stop playing basketball?", "id": "1999-W03-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who was Babe's husband?", "id": "1999-W03-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where did Babe's daughter find scrapbooks?", "id": "1999-W03-5-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "The world lost a basketball hero this week -- and we're not talking about Michael Jordan.

None of the members of the team expected to do as well as they did.  They were just a group of young women from the same school who liked to play basketball. Their coach was  teacher J.

For 25 years -- from 1915 to 1940 -- they brought great honour to Canada and their home city , Edmonton. When they finally retired, the Grads had 108 championships to their credit. They won at all levels--local, regional, national, international and world.   Of the 522 games they played they won 502!   The inventor of the game of basketball, Dr. James Naismith called the Edmonton Grads \"the finest basketball team that ever stepped out on a floor\". Babe Belanger played with the Grads from 1929 to 1937.  She was a forward and she stood only 5 feet, 2 inches tall. In those days, marriage meant an end to a young women's career. Babe Belanger married Ian MacLean, who continued the family sports tradition. He later became a trainer for Edmonton hockey teams and the Edmonton Eskimos and B.C. Lions football teams. Babe never talked about her fabulous career.

In Paris, France members of carillon associations - people who are experts at ringing bells - coordinated the ringing of cathedral bells across the city. And there was bell-ringing in approximately 30 Buddhist temples and Christian churches in 10 cities throughout Japan, including Hiroshima, Tokyo and Osaka. The pact was agreed to by 130 countries in Ottawa, Ontario in 1997. Russia, the United States, China and Ukraine did not sign the treaty. Despite these notable absences, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jody Williams, of The International Campaign to Ban Landmines, says the accord has an impact for many other countries in the world. The head of the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan described the treaty's entry into force as a milestone. \"It is a day whose arrival few could have predicted, and whose import to the millions whose lives or limbs may be saved from these barbarous weapons cannot be overestimated,\" Mr. Annan said. Pope John Paul added his voice to the effort, urging more countries to sign the treaty. The treaty prohibits the use, production and storage of anti-personnel landmines and sets a time limit for destroying stocks and clearing mine fields. There are two categories of landmines: antipersonnel (AP) and antitank or anti-vehicle (AT): -Anti-personnel (AP) landmine - \"A mine designed to be exploded by the presence, proximity or contact of a person and that will incapacitate, injure or kill one or more persons.\" -Anti-tank (AT) landmine - An AT mine is a device designed to detonate by more than 100 kilograms of pressure. AT mines cannot distinguish between a tank and tractor The United States has refused to sign the treaty, saying it needs the mines for its defence along the border between North and South Korea. The governments of North and South Korea have been in constant conflict for more then 40 years. Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy spearheaded the political initiative to get the treaty ratified. \"For us, this is a very important day,\" Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said.

Lloyd Oldford of Red Cliff, Bonavista Bay, a fisherman who first alerted Efford to the problem, said the video in no way shows the true extent of the destruction fishermen are seeing. \"I can show you 100 miles of it,\" said Oldford. \"There's nothing but dead fish in every crook and cranny. It's everywhere, massive destruction. It's taking away a great source of income from us. If we don't do something about this seal problem, more people are going to be leaving the province.\" John Efford, Newfoundland's fisheries minister, says the \"very disturbing\" images will wake up people to the toll seals are taking on northern cod stocks. There has been a moratorium - a temporary ban -  on fishing for cod since 1992 after fish stocks dropped to dangerous levels. \"We thought by bringing in the moratorium, that in a few years the cod stocks would start to return,\" he says. \"But seven years after the closure of the ground fish industry, stocks today are worse then they were previous to 1992. \"There's only one answer to that.... We've got an overpopulated seal herd.\" Mr. Efford says the seal herd, which is estimated at six million, needs to be cut in half. That would mean increasing the annual quota of 275,000 harp seals to between 475,000 and 575,000 animals. Jeff Hutchings, a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia says it is a stretch for Mr. Efford to use evidence of seals preying on cod in one location to argue for a massive cull (harvest) of the seal herd. \"The degree to which seals are retarding the recovery of cod stocks remains an open question. Maybe they are. Maybe they aren't.\" He adds that documentation of seals having eaten only the fish stomachs suggests scientists may have underestimated how many cod the seals kill. Researchers detect traces of fish in seal stomachs only if they eat the whole fish. Today, sealing comprises a vital part of Newfoundland's sluggish economy. In 1996 alone it was worth in excess of $11 million, with seal products being sold in Canada, Norway and Asia."}]}, {"title": "B.C.
