Well, that is exactly what the federal government is doing concerning a million dollar gift to the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, Ontario.  And it appears the government does not like what it has found. To continue the metaphor, it look like this horse has some major dental problems. The government has been looking at a charitable donation by Ottawa Senators hockey star Alexi Yashin. Earlier this year he promised to give one million dollars to the National Arts Centre, a concert hall where people go to see plays and dance and to hear live music. Many Canadians were delighted to see that Alexi Yashin was donating so much money. Mr. Yashin makes a salary of more than three million dollars a season. It is very expensive to put on live performances and the National Arts Centre has recently had to raise ticket prices and cut back on performances because of a lack of funds. It was the most famous donation ever to the National Arts Centre. Mr. Yashin's popularity soared. But then this week Mr. Yashin's donation turned sour. After giving the Centre $200,000 Alexi Yashin made an about face. He decided not to give the other $800,000 he had promised. He says his decision was for personal reasons. But it now looks like Alexi Yashin was not really being honest. It seems he actually changed his mind because federal Auditor General Denis Desautels told him he was trying to break the law. Mr. Yashin originally announced he was a lover of the arts. He said that as a well paid hockey player he wanted to help the National Arts Centre put on new performances. But behind the scenes his plan was not to give the Arts Centre one million dollars. Instead, in a secret agreement, the National Arts Centre would have hired Mr. Yashin's parents at $85,000 a year. They would have been paid out of Alexi Yashin's yearly $200,000 donation. What's more, his parents would not have to actually work. This was a way for Alexi Yashin to give money to his parents while illegally saving thousands of dollars in taxes. As well, a lawyer working for Mr. Yashin was to get $15,000 out of the remaining $115,000. So in fact the million dollar donation would really only be half of that. It would have been a great public relations victory. Mr. Yashin would look like he was being very generous. But behind the scenes he was really much less so. Yesterday evening the Ottawa Senators were playing in Boston. After the game reporters went to the locker room to ask Alexi Yashin what was going on. But he refused to talk to reporters about his \"personal reasons\" for cancelling his donation. He said simply that \"I know I didn't do anything illegal. I know I didn't do anything wrong. I can't control what they say. It's a free country.\" He also said he wanted to focus on hockey and nothing else. The other players and coach of the Ottawa Senators would not comment either. They said it was Alexi's personal affair and not important to them. Many Ottawa-area hockey fans are deeply disappointed with what is going on. \"People here are puzzled. They feel let down,\" says Rick Soweita, who owns a sports bar. \"He benefited from the publicity and now he's got to own up.\""}]}, {"title": "Tragedy strikes Rankin family", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who did John Morris Rankin play for?", "id": "2000-W03-1-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the Rankins", "answer_start": 251}]}, {"question": "How many records did his musical group sell?", "id": "2000-W03-1-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "more than two million", "answer_start": 1203}]}, {"question": "What is hypothermia?", "id": "2000-W03-1-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "when one's body temperature drops abnormally low", "answer_start": 702}]}, {"question": "When did John Morris Rankin tell the teenagers to jump out of the truck?", "id": "2000-W03-1-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "as the truck skidded towards the water", "answer_start": 394}]}, {"question": "Where was Jimmy Rankin when he heard the news of his brother's death?", "id": "2000-W03-1-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a Farm Aid concert in Toronto", "answer_start": 1986}]}, {"question": "What musical instruments did John Morris Rankin play?", "id": "2000-W03-1-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "fiddle and piano", "answer_start": 817}]}, {"question": "How old is Molly Rankin?", "id": "2000-W03-1-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "13", "answer_start": 2438}]}, {"question": "Who is the lead vocalist of Prairie Oyster?", "id": "2000-W03-1-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Russell De Carle", "answer_start": 2065}]}, {"question": "Who is Denis Ryan?", "id": "2000-W03-1-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "friend of the Rankin family", "answer_start": 160}]}, {"question": "Why did Rankin's musical group break up?", "id": "2000-W03-1-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "so its members could pursue independent careers and interests", "answer_start": 915}]}], "context": "Three teenage boys were able to escape a truck that crashed in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia yesterday. But the driver and father of one of the teenagers was not so lucky. John Morris Rankin, a member of the former Celtic group the Rankins, was killed in the accident. Family friend Emily Butler said it appeared that Rankin told the teens to jump out of the truck as it skidded towards the water. \"John Morris told them to jump and they got out,\" she said. \"John Morris went with the truck.\" It hasn't yet been determined how the vehicle ended up in the water. Morris Green of Nova Scotia Emergency Health Services said one of the teenagers was being treated for hypothermia -- when one's body temperature drops abnormally low -- and the other two appeared to be OK. John Morris Rankin played fiddle and piano with the popular musical family from Cape Breton. The group broke up last summer so its members could pursue independent careers and interests. Over a decade-long, storybook career, the Mabou, Nova Scotia family band rose from playing at county fairs and church halls to become the most successful music acts on the East Coast through the 1990s. The five siblings sold more than two million records, won five Juno Awards, including group of the year in 1994, and took its Celtic music to the world. Family friend and musician Denis Ryan said news of the accident spread quickly through the Nova Scotia music community. \"It's awful, awful, awful,\" said Ryan, who played music with Rankin in the mid '80s. \"I've known him for 25 years.... Why is it always the good people that die?\" Ryan described Rankin as a dedicated family man and master carpenter who was like a younger brother to him. \"He was just a beautiful person to be around -- never offensive and could be awful funny at times. And he did have a great Celtic humour and wit about him. He could laugh and smile and have fun with very simple things in life.\" Rankin's brother Jimmy Rankin left a Farm Aid concert in Toronto after being notified of the death. Family friend Russell De Carle, lead singer for Prairie Oyster, said he was stunned when he heard the news at the benefit. \"He was a brilliant musician. It's a huge loss. It's unbelievable. I had an incredible amount of admiration for his playing. He was a brilliant musician, keyboardist and fiddle player.\" Besides Michael, 15, Rankin is survived by his wife Sally and daughter Molly, 13."}]}, {"title": "A Refugee's Story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where in China did the woman come from?", "id": "1999-W47-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Fujian province", "answer_start": 30}]}, {"question": "Why can't the woman be identified by name?", "id": "1999-W47-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "because of a legal order", "answer_start": 645}]}, {"question": "How many other people arrived in Canada with the woman?", "id": "1999-W47-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "32", "answer_start": 764}]}, {"question": "What will happen to the Chinese people whose requests for refugee status fail?", "id": "1999-W47-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "they will be sent back to China", "answer_start": 808}]}, {"question": "When did the woman get pregnant for the second time?", "id": "1999-W47-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "seven years ago", "answer_start": 861}]}, {"question": "How many children are Chinese couples allowed to have?", "id": "1999-W47-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "one", "answer_start": 0}]}, {"question": "What will happen to the woman if she returns to China?", "id": "1999-W47-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "she will be sterilized", "answer_start": 813}]}, {"question": "Who is Larry Smeets?", "id": "1999-W47-5-11", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the lawyer representing the Chinese woman from Fujian", "answer_start": 607}]}], "context": "One of the women from China's Fujian province told a compelling story to the Immigration and Refugee Board yesterday. She is applying to be accepted as a refugee to Canada. She was on one of the boats from China that was intercepted by the Coast Guard off the coast of British Columbia earlier this year. According to international law, a refugee is a person who has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to be protected by his own country. The Chinese woman can't be identified because of a legal order, but it seems her claim to be accepted as a refugee to Canada may succeed where the claims of 32 people who arrived with her have failed. They will be sent back to China. The woman says that seven years ago she got pregnant for the second time. That violates a Chinese law. Couples in China are only allowed to have one child. She tried to hide from the authorities, but they found her when she was eight months pregnant and took her to hospital. She said through an interpreter, \"The baby was born alive. They put the baby in a bucket. I heard the baby crying for a short time and I wanted to hold the baby but I couldn't. Later, the doctor told me the baby was no longer living.\" When she heard a ship was going to Canada, she decided to get on board. She planned to seek refugee status and bring her husband and child. So far, every refugee claim from the Chinese migrants has been rejected, usually because the board has found no evidence of persecution. This case may be different. The woman also says her family received a notice that she'll be sterilized so she can't have any more babies if she returns to China. Larry Smeets, her lawyer, says the Federal Court of Appeal has concluded in the past that forced sterilization was a form of persecution, so this reason could be recognized as a reason for refugees to be allowed to remain in Canada. Since there is little evidence beyond the woman's own testimony, the decision depends on whether the board members believe she is telling the truth."}]}, {"title": "More Money Than Brains?", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where is Todd McFarlane originally from?", "id": "1999-W07-2-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Calgary", "answer_start": 482}]}, {"question": "How old is Todd McFarlane?", "id": "1999-W07-2-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "37", "answer_start": 470}]}, {"question": "When did Todd McFarlane buy Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball?", "id": "1999-W07-2-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "January 12, 1999", "answer_start": 1906}]}, {"question": "How many historic baseballs does McFarlane now own?", "id": "1999-W07-2-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "9", "answer_start": 911}]}, {"question": "What does McFarlane want in return for making the \"McFarlane Collection\" available to places like the National Baseball Hall of Fame?", "id": "1999-W07-2-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "to take 20 swings in every major league ball park", "answer_start": 1493}]}, {"question": "Whose ball did McFarlane buy for about $250,000 Canadian dollars?", "id": "1999-W07-2-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Sammy Sosa's final home run of the season, No. 66", "answer_start": 2080}]}, {"question": "How often is there a Toy Fair in New York?", "id": "1999-W07-2-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "yearly", "answer_start": 674}]}], "context": "The Canadian man who spent more than $4 million dollars to buy Mark McGwire s 70th home run ball finally identified himself yesterday. He admitted he was a \"psycho fan\" and a \"sports geek.\" The mystery man is Todd McFarlane, the creator of Spawn comic books, who says his purchase \"was a mixture of business, charity and self-indulgence to the nth degree.\" \"Sports make you forget death, taxes and politics, and all the other garbage that goes on in life,\" he says. The 37-year-old Calgary native who now lives in Tempe, Arizona, is part owner of the NHL s Edmonton Oilers. He has a company that makes action figures, and says the timing of his announcement was tied to the yearly Toy Fair in New York. Mr. McFarlane, who paid $3,005,000 U.S. for home run ball no. 70, had not seen the ball until Monday, when he came to New York fresh from a stay at the Baltimore Orioles  fantasy camp in Florida. He now owns 9 historic baseballs. Yesterday they were displayed in front of him in nine cases atop nine columns - white and  grey for No. 70, black for the others - with four burgundy velvet ropes separating them from the crowd and five men in blue security uniforms standing to the side. He says he would like to allow the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York to show McGwire s 70th home run ball at times. He would make it available to charities to raise money, and would let individual major league teams display it. And what would he like in return? \"I d like to be able to take 20 swings in every major league ball park,\" he says. Mr. McFarlane, who owns autographs from Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, says purchasing the ball was cheaper than buying a sports team. In all, McFarlane bought nine home run balls hit by McGwire and Sammy Sosa, including McGwires, 63rd, 67th, 68th and 69th, and Sosa s 33rd (his record 20th in June), 61st and 66th. Mr. McFarlane bought the ball at auction January 12, paying more than $3 million Canadian to Philip Ozersky. The research scientist caught the ball September 27 at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri. Sammy Sosa s final home run of the season, No. 66, cost Mr. McFarlane about $250,000 Canadian.  All the  others he bought at the auction cost under $20,000 apiece. \"I blew my life savings on this,\" McFarlane says. \"I m not like the American billionaire Donald Trump. I don t have a lot of cash.\" The group of balls will be called The McFarlane Collection. \"Given that I name all my corporations after myself, I ll name it after myself,\" he said. \"Better than  The Guy Who Has More Money Than Brains Collection.  \" Source: The Canadian Press, CBC News"}]}, {"title": "Blind mountaineer to climb Mount Logan", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where is Ross Watson a town councillor?", "id": "2000-W06-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Cochrane, Alberta", "answer_start": 36}]}, {"question": "Whom does Watson plan to join on a journey to the top of the 5,945-metre Mount Logan?", "id": "2000-W06-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "six other climbers", "answer_start": 178}]}, {"question": "Where is Mt.

Local union president Kurt Moench says funding needs to be provided for teacher salaries and student growth.

Yugoslavia is bracing for air strikes by NATO forces. Reporters say the siren lasted about 90 seconds. There was a brief pause before the siren sounded again. Yugoslav authorities have declared a state of emergency. They are getting ready for war. They've shut down the country's main independent radio station and they're preparing shelters for the civilian population. This is happening because the coalition of countries that are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organizatoin (NATO) want to stop the Yugoslavians from invading the neighbouring region of Kosovo. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which is one of the republics that make up Yugoslavia. Ninety per cent of Kosovo's population are ethnic Albanians, who have been pushing for independence from Serbia. Brigadier-General Michel Maisonneuve is the senior Canadian Forces officer who has been serving with NATO. He adds that \"Kosovo is a beautiful part of Yugoslavia. It is relatively flat, with mountains surrounding it, as well as a spine that runs up the middle. The province is in large majority ethnic Albanian, with many other minorities, including Serbs, gypsies, Turks, etc. The people are hospitable and hardy.\" The conflict that is being played out today has roots that go back hundreds and hundreds of years. In 1389, Serbs lost a key battle against the forces of the invading Ottoman Empire on the fields of Kosovo. The defeat marks the beginning of the end of Serbia's Medieval Empire. Kosovo became part of the Ottoman Empire. In the following centuries that battle become the key event in Serbian and Albanian national history. Over the last decade there have been many attempts at a peaceful settlement. Representatives of the NATO countries have tried to negotiate with the government of Yugoslavia. Those negotions failed earlier this week. NATO says that bombing Yugoslavia is the only way to get them to stop their assault on Kosovo. The question is no longer if, but when, NATO will begin bombing. NATO Secretary General Javier Solana assured Yugoslovia's neighbours today that the alliance would protect them in the event of attacks by Yugoslavia. Yugoslav officials say they might not be able to win a war against NATO, but they feel they can inflict serious damage. NATO military planners aren't taking the threats lightly. Few people believe that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is ready to give in. He opposes outside interference in Kosovo.

The Labrador Inuit Association has made a deal with the Canadian Federal Government and Newfoundland's Provincial Government that will give them 73,000 square kilometres of land in Labrador, $255 million in cash, and the right to some self-government. The deal also guarantees the Inuit rights to hunting and fishing on the land and ocean in the area, rights to participate in wildlife and resource management, and environmental protection. On Monday, the Labrador Inuit voted overwhelmingly in favour of the agreement. Native land claims are modern agreements that provide an aboriginal group with land, resources and some power to govern themselves. The Labrador Inuit claim some parts of northern Labrador and northeastern Quebec belong to them. They want to govern themselves in land that they claim as their own. This would be the first land claims agreement the Labrador Inuit have ever signed. They have never before made a land claims agreement with the Government of Canada, or the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The president of the Labrador Inuit Association says this deal is the best one the Inuit have been offered in the many years of negotiations.

Measles is on track to being eliminated throughout North and South America by the turn of the millennium. At least that's the opinion of a number of health experts. Last year Canada had only 12 cases of measles, down from about 2,500 in 1995. \"It has been a surprise to me that measles has disappeared as quickly as it did,\" says Donald Henderson of the Pan American Health Organization. Most children who get measles will have a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, and watery eyes. These symptoms last for 1 or 2 weeks. But measles also causes ear infections in nearly 1 out of every 10 children who get it. As many as 1 out of 20 children with measles gets pneumonia. And about 1 child in every 1,000 who get measles will get encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain that can lead to convulsions, and can leave the child deaf or mentally disabled. For every 1,000 children who get measles, 1 or 2 will die from it. Measles can also make a pregnant woman have a miscarriage or give birth prematurely. Anti-measles immunization began in Canada in 1957. Before that virtually every child went through a bout with the disease. But the single-dose vaccine was not fully effective. In August 1995 an advisory committee recommended that all children be given a second dose of vaccine. The new policy was adopted in all provinces and territories. Rubella, commonly referred to as German measles, is a different disease with similar symptoms. It remains a problem and is one of the next targets for elimination. Measles is the latest in a string of successes for childhood vaccination programs, but experts fear they could be undermined by growing public suspicion about the risks and side-effects of immunization. Last year a group of Manitoba parents went to court in an effort to block a program to immunize Grade Four students against Hepatitis B. They lost their court case, but many parents chose not to have their children vaccinated, says Robert Pless of the federal Laboratory Centre for Disease Control."}]}, {"title": "Her Excellency Adrienne Clarkson", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who delivered the Oath of Office to Adrienne Clarkson?", "id": "1999-W41-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Supreme Court of Canada Justice Claire L'Heureux Dube", "answer_start": 157}]}, {"question": "Where did the swearing-in of Ms. Clarkson take place?", "id": "1999-W41-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Ottawa", "answer_start": 621}]}, {"question": "While in office, what title does Ms. Clarkson assume?", "id": "1999-W41-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Excellency", "answer_start": 437}]}, {"question": "Who did Ms. Clarkson praise during her speech?", "id": "1999-W41-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "her 92-year-old father and her mother", "answer_start": 911}]}, {"question": "When did Ms. Clarkson's family arrive in Canada?", "id": "1999-W41-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1942", "answer_start": 1049}]}, {"question": "How did Ms. Clarkson say her teachers treated her?", "id": "1999-W41-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "\"as bright, not bright yellow\"", "answer_start": 1295}]}, {"question": "As Governor General, who does Ms. Clarkson represent?", "id": "1999-W41-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the Queen of England", "answer_start": 1368}]}, {"question": "As Governor General, Ms. Clarkson presides over the swearing-in of what Canadian officials?", "id": "1999-W41-5-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of Canada and cabinet ministers", "answer_start": 1841}]}], "context": "Former CBC broadcaster Adrienne Clarkson was installed as Canada's 26th Governor General yesterday morning.

The NATO troops are there to make sure that Yugoslavian soldiers leave the area. At least 10,000 Serbian soldiers and police have already left, along with all Serb military aircraft.

They fear that when the ethnic Albanians return to the area now that the war is over, they may try to take revenge on the ethnic Serbs. With belongings lashed to the top of their cars, the new refugees said they were heading northwards to the Kosovo capital of Pristina or all the way to Serbia itself.

Today he is in a Mexican hotel, waiting to find out when he will finally be allowed to fly back to Montreal. Pascal, who is 20, was released yesterday from the Chiapas state penitentiary of Cerro Hueco -- where he had staged a hunger strike to protest his arrest last September 28th. He was set free after relatives paid a $1,200 fine. Last fall Mexican prosecutors charged Pascal with stealing small clay figurines from the Palenque ruins. He was put in jail in January. A local judge found Hudon guilty of the theft charges. Under Mexican law, all pre-Hispanic artifacts are considered national treasures. \"He's very happy because he's returning to his country,\" his lawyer, Alphonso Herrera Gonzalez, said. \"He called me from a pay phone to say he was finally free,\" his mother, Jocelyne Dion, told the french language newspaper Le Journal de Montreal. \"He was shouting with joy.\" For the Mexican authorities, their fight to prevent the looting of Mexico's vast stash of historical treasures is far from resolved. \"Looting and the illegal export of archeological goods is fairly prevalent,\" says Joaquin Garcia, chairman of Mexico's archeology council. Mexico has about 200,000 archeological sites, and only about 150 are monitored constantly and open to the public, he said. \"It's quite difficult to take care of them. We depend much on the people who live near the sites.\" Although Mexico has had laws to prevent looting since the middle of the 19th century, Mexicans have become increasingly alarmed lately about losing their national heritage to looters, and have started to apply their laws with greater vigilance. Mr. Hudon was a prime example of the new get-tough attitude. The former college student was found carrying eight pieces of ceramics, which he said he found on a path in the bush near the Palenque historical site in southern Mexico. Mr. Hudon has said he had intended to hand over the pottery to authorities, but before he had a chance to do so, he was stopped by police. They searched him and charged him with illegally possessing artifacts. He was put in a federal prison in Tuxtla Gutierrez in Chiapas state in the south of Mexico at the beginning of January. At a trial in February, he was sentenced to a year in jail plus one month of labour, and told to pay $72,000 to the National Institute of History and Anthropology. His family and friends in Montreal protested, and Mr. Hudon went on a hunger strike. The Canadian embassy intervened, and Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy spoke publicly about the need to get the young man out of prison in Chiapas. Last month, Mr. Hudon appealed the case. He was allowed to give a new statement through a translator. The judge ruled that he was not legally obliged to pay $72,000 to the institute, and lowered the fine to $2,500. Artifacts, some dating back tens of thousands of years, are frequently stolen when sites are discovered by excavators or through small-scale looting, he said. There has been looting at only three major projects in the past 15 years -- projects run by foreign experts. All three were halted and many artifacts recovered. Small-scale looting, however, has landed between 40 and 50 people in jail every year. And Mr. Garcia is sure much theft goes undetected. Despite his serious troubles, Pascal has not lost the urge to travel. He told his mom that after he visits with his family back in Montreal, he wants to head out to British Columbia to work as a tree-planter.

He and his parents refused traditional treatments, such as chemotherapy (radiation treatment) and amputation. Instead they decided to use herbal, and alternative treatments that included large doses of vitamins and a special diet. The Saskatchewan government didn't think alternative medicine would work, and felt Tyrell's parents were pressuring him to refuse traditional medicine. The province went to court to force him to undergo surgery for the cancer in his leg. Tyrell waited three months for treatment as his case went through the courts. When it was discovered the cancer had spread to Tyrell's lungs, the province dropped the case. Shortly after, Tyrell's parents took the boy to Mexico for the alternative treatment. Doctors in Mexico said he was cancer-free. They said that Canadian doctors got the diagnosis wrong. Tyrell returned from Mexico in April. His condition got worse. Tyrell's tumour started bleeding and he needed blood transfusions. He was admitted to hospital and died Wednesday night.

A suitcase belonging Lauren, a prescription bottle with Carolyn's name, and pieces of a plane similar to Kennedy's were all found in the water. They also found bits of foam insulation believed to have come from the airplane. The Kennedy family is no stranger to tragedy. In 1963, John Jr's father, U.S. President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated in Dallas. Other Kennedys, including two of John Jr's cousins and his uncle, also died under tragic circumstances.

Camille Laurin was 76. He had been ill with cancer. Dr. Laurin was a psychiatrist who became active in Quebec politics during the 1960's. He was first elected to the Quebec National Assembly, Quebec's legislative assembly,  in 1970. Dr. Camille Laurin once described his beloved language law as the \"re-conquest\" of Quebec. He was referring to the history of Quebec. During the 18th and 19th century, French-speaking Quebecers were often ruled by governments that were controlled by England. Many French-speaking Quebecers considered themselves to have been conquered by \"les anglais\" - the English. By the 1950's French-speaking Quebecers were increasingly convinced that the only way to stand up for their own rights was for Quebec to become an independent country, separate from Canada. Camille Laurin was among them. Bill 101 required signs in Quebec to be in French. Before Bill 101 became law many signs in Quebec were only in English, even though the majority of the population is French speaking. Bill 101 also required the children of immigrants to go to French schools. Many French-speaking Quebecers were worried that immigrants would choose English schools for their children. That would mean that the French language would slowly die away. Many English-speaking Quebecers did not like Bill 101 because they felt it took away their freedom to put up English signs. They also disagreed with the government telling immigrants which schools they must attend. Bill 101 came into effect in 1977. For many years it was big news in Quebec as there were many demonstrations - both from people who supported the bill and from those who hated it. One thing was never in question, however, was Dr. Laurin's passionate love of Quebec. \"Dr. Laurin was a pioneer, a builder, a man of conviction, determined,\" says Francois Gendron, chairman of the Parti Quebecois caucus in the legislature. Liberal opposition Leader Jean Charest praised his protection of the French language. \"He was a man who was devoted to the interests of Quebec  and in that sense today is a day of sadness for us.\" To some in the English-language community, Laurin symbolized francophones who wanted to crush the anglophone minority. William Johnson, a hardline English-rights activist, said he was personally saddened by the death of his ideological opponent. \"He was very cultivated man, with a seductive charm.\" But the president of the Alliance Quebec English-rights lobby condemned Laurin's masterwork as an attempt to \"wipe out bilingualism\" in Canada. Bill 101 is credited by Quebec nationalists as helping preserve the French language in a sea of English in North America. Dr. Laurin made no apologies for the law's toughness, saying the law simply reflected Quebec's demographic reality. Although it meant a lower profile for anglophones and less clout after years of predominance, Laurin said it took away no basic rights and recognized their institutions, schools and media."}]}, {"title": "Montreal Students Protest in the Streets", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why were the students protesting?", "id": "1999-W39-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the lack of extra-curricular activities in schools", "answer_start": 161}]}, {"question": "How are Montreal teachers pressuring the provincial government?", "id": "1999-W39-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "by refusing to do any activities that are not paid", "answer_start": 335}]}, {"question": "How large a fine do the students who are arrested face?", "id": "1999-W39-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "$100", "answer_start": 582}]}, {"question": "Who says the disorganized protests are becoming dangerous?", "id": "1999-W39-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "deputy police director Serge Meloche", "answer_start": 594}]}, {"question": "When did students begin to take to the streets of Quebec to express their frustrations?", "id": "1999-W39-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "during the past few days", "answer_start": 785}]}, {"question": "What did police get pelted with during the demonstrations?", "id": "1999-W39-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "rocks and garbage", "answer_start": 1050}]}, {"question": "Where did students rove?", "id": "1999-W39-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "between two east-end high schools", "answer_start": 1088}]}], "context": "Montreal police arrested more than 250 high school students yesterday.

The goal is to show some wayward Inuit the traditional ways. On a typical day in this northern community, a hunting party is about to head out. This one includes two prisoners from the Baffin Correctional Centre (BCC), both convicted of assault, both trying to reconnect with Inuit traditions and culture. Moshe Akavak, a guard with the BCC says learning the traditional ways will help the prisoners' rehabilitation. \"If they go out, they keep themselves busy doing hunting, repairing equipment, it's good for them.\" The party is hunting caribou, far from the city on the frozen tundra. Michael Evic is serving a two-year sentence for assault and other crimes. Out on the tundra with the hunting party he aims at his prey with a high powered rifle. His first shot misses. He tries again. This time he's successful. Inuit believe it takes more than killing an animal to become a hunter. What happens afterwards is just as important. Part of the instruction is learning how to carefully skin and carve a caribou the way Inuit have always done it. When Moshe Akavak became a jail guard 16 years ago, he was appalled so many Inuit had lost their traditional skills. He believes that's why some became criminals. \"Anything they learn from the land program, or from other people, of course, they will be willing to pass on to their children.\" He says over the years hundreds of prisoners have been given guns and knives and taught how to use them. There's never been a problem. \"The more you trust other people, you also gain it back.\" This is just one of the traditional hunting programs for prisoners. In the summer they go after seals. Depending on how well they do they could be sent to an outpost camp where they'll hunt and fish for months at a time. It's all very expensive, costing tens of thousands of dollars for equipment, clothing and supervision. But many believe it's money well spent. \"Whenever you have inmates that come out of jail feeling good about themselves and wanting to succeed I think that cost is well borne out in terms of perhaps reduced recidivism [a return to committing crimes].  And I think you have the chance for these people to return to their communities and contribute,\" says John McKnight, warden of the centre. The prisoners, like Michael Evic, believe learning traditional hunting skills will straighten out their lives. \"I'll just keep on working and go hunting on weekends and keep out of booze or drugs, that was my problem,\" Evic says."}]}, {"title": "Canadians Triumph Over Harsh Desert", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who said Bedouin ways are \"a death in life.\"?", "id": "1999-W12-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "T.E.

For this cruel land can cast a spell which no temperate clime can match.\" - T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) While adventurer Jamie Clarke was crossing the world s harshest desert, he often thought his 1997 trip up Mount Everest had been easier. \"I ll never cross the Rub al-Khaly again,\" said the adventurer from Calgary, Alberta of his 39-day trek across the Arabian desert. \"But I d climb Everest.\" Clarke spoke from the comfort of a hotel room in Abu Dhabi and recalled the desert s challenges: threatening quicksand, mountainous sand dunes and blazing heat. Halfway through the journey, Clarke thought his chances of completing the trek were slim. But he and his team fought frustration, thirst, sandstorms and a scorching sun to make the 1,200-km journey that took them from Oman, through Saudi Arabia and into the United Arab Emirates. Not only did the six-man, 12-camel team make it, they beat their own deadline by three days. \"We are tired, thirsty and hungry, but ecstatic to be here,\" Clarke said. Clarke and two other Calgary residents, his brother Leigh and friend Bruce Kirkby, set out Feb. 2 from Salalah, Oman, along with three Bedouin guides and their camels. On March 12, they reached Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. They became the first Westerners in more than fifty years to cross the severe Arabian desert. \"The first thing I did when I came to the hotel was open the tap and pour a glass of cold water,\" Clarke said. \"In the desert, you had to be really thirsty to drink water stored in goat skin.\" He described the stored water, which became contaminated with goat hair and fat, as tasting like \"watered chocolate milk.\" He marvels at how lucky we are to be able to drink from a tap. There are no permanent roads or settlements in the desert, which covers 300,000 square kilometres of southern Arabia. It has been a lure to adventurers since British traveller Wilfred Thesiger crossed it in 1947 and wrote about his journey. Daytime temperatures reached 49 degrees Celsius, with the sand even hotter: 80 degrees Celsius. At night, the temperature fell as low as nine degrees. \"Before the journey, for months, all I thought about was being in the desert. I dreamt about it,\" Clarke said. \"When I got there, I couldn t wait to finish.\" Clarke said his relationship with the camels left an lasting mark on him. \"The camel became part of me. I became part of the camel. Listening to it, feeling it, becomes an extension of you because your life depends on it.\" He added that \"you have to be nice to it, you have to talk softly and show your love\" or you ll be trying to work with a grumpy, screaming beast. The trek left the men with blistered skin, chapped lips and less weight. Each lost at least 11 pounds. Clarke and his team sent reports and photos about their trip by satellite phone to a Web site that drew more than three million visitors. \"The kids were a great motivation, I felt they were cheering us on. \"I wouldn't advise someone to go there for 40 days. Maybe three, four days tops.\""}]}, {"title": "A New Look at Marijuana", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is the scientific name for marijuana?", "id": "1999-W10-4-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Cannabis sativa", "answer_start": 385}]}, {"question": "What is the Health Department's study going to examine about marijuana?", "id": "1999-W10-4-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "how the drug should be administered and how a safe supply could be distributed to patients", "answer_start": 802}]}, {"question": "Who has the Canadian Health Department consulted with about obtaining marijuana?", "id": "1999-W10-4-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the Food and Drug Administration in the United States", "answer_start": 1049}]}, {"question": "Why was Mark Crossley sentenced to house arrest?", "id": "1999-W10-4-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "for growing marijuana", "answer_start": 1959}]}, {"question": "Where has marijuana already been approved for medical use?", "id": "1999-W10-4-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "several American states", "answer_start": 3051}]}, {"question": "How long does it take for delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol to be absorbed into the bloodstream when someone smokes marijuana?", "id": "1999-W10-4-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "minutes", "answer_start": 1787}]}], "context": "The federal government has plans to take a new look at the use of marijuana for people who are suffering from painful diseases such as cancer, AIDS and multiple sclerosis. All use of marijuana is now illegal in Canada. But if a scientific study of the drug shows that it can help relieve pain in some people, it could be legalized for medical use only. Marijuana is the common name of Cannabis sativa, a plant which contains more than 400 chemicals. What is commonly referred to as marijuana (\"grass\", \"pot\", \"weed\") in North America is usually made up of crushed cannabis leaves, flowers, and often twigs. Health Minister Allan Rock announced yesterday that his department is putting together guidelines for a scientific look at marijuana. The study would examine how the drug should be administered, and how a safe supply could be distributed to patients. \"There are people who are dying,\" Mr. Rock said. \"They want access to something they believe will help with their symptoms. We want to help.\" The Health Department has already consulted with the Food and Drug Administration in the United States -- which is also planning similar trials -- about acquiring marijuana for the tests. Making marijuana available to patients by prescription will not mean changes to the criminal code. Marijuana could be administered under an existing section of the Food and Drug Act, which allows for special access to prohibited substances. The belief that marijuana eases pain in some patients has been growing -- although people continue to face criminal charges across Canada even when they claim to be using it for medical purposes. THC (delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol) is the main psychoactive part of marijuana. When marijuana is smoked, THC is absorbed from the lungs to the bloodstream within minutes. Mark Crossley is a 38-year-old Nova Scotia man with an inoperable brain tumour.  He was sentenced last week to four months of house arrest and 18 months probation for growing marijuana in his backyard. He said he received the sentence even after the court was told he smoked the drug to deal with the painful headaches and appetite loss caused by his cancer. His doctor approved. Mr. Rock said his announcement is not a step toward a widespread legalization of the drug. \"This has nothing to do with legalizing marijuana,\" he said. But he added, \"I think Canadians support on a compassionate basis, if someone is dying, access to a substance that could alleviate their suffering.\" An Edmonton doctor who specializes in pain management agrees with the federal government's move.  Doctor Helen Hays studied a patient who smoked marijuana to fight the symptoms of a painful muscle disorder. \"There was a tremendous improvement,\" she said.

In ancient Greece and Rome, the planet's fiery red hue made skywatchers think of their god of war. That fascination continues today. Was there ever any life on Mars? What was it like? Is there any possibility that there is life there now? Early this afternoon, NASA's Mars Polar Lander touches down on the surface of the red planet. Scientists will get a chance to get the answers to many questions. The Polar Lander has been hurtling through hundreds of millions of kilometres of space for the past 11 months. It's hoped that the $200 million Polar Lander will help solve an old mystery -- whether there's ever been life-sustaining water on Earth's nearest planetary neighbour. The American space ship is being navigated by radio signals from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"It's a very complex process,\" says Sam Thurman, flight operations manager. \"There are literally years of effort by hundreds of different people behind making those five minutes of events happen.\" Once on the surface, the craft's instruments will be deployed -- some to test the atmosphere, others to claw out samples of dust and, possibly, ice. For the first time ever, NASA has included a microphone on a spacecraft sent to Mars, an idea originally proposed by astronomer Carl Sagan. There are fears that the costly mission could hit a rock or lose contact with NASA scientists back home. \"The biggest risk ... is Mars itself,\" says Sarah Gavit, NASA project manager. \"We have never been to the south pole of Mars before and we're not exactly sure what we are going into.\" Frozen water exists on Mars in its northern ice cap. But scientists believe there may be more underground. The Polar Lander will try to find evidence that the atmosphere was once warmer and thicker. Its landing site is believed to be an area where climate changes caused layering of dust and ice that can be read like the rings of a tree trunk. Any answers from the probe would help focus future missions searching for past or present life, which is dependent on water, though the Lander's instruments cannot detect fossils or living organisms."}]}, {"title": "Who Wrote Sarah's Songs?", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why is producer Daryl Neudorf suing singer Sarah McLachlan?", "id": "1999-W27-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "for song writing credit and a share of money from her first album", "answer_start": 169}]}, {"question": "Where is this case being tried?", "id": "1999-W27-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Vancouver, British Columbia", "answer_start": 105}]}, {"question": "What does Neudorf claim about the eight songs on Sarah McLachlan's first album?", "id": "1999-W27-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "he co-wrote four of those songs ", "answer_start": 613}]}, {"question": "How is Neudorf given credit on the album cover?", "id": "1999-W27-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "for pre-production, coordination and production assistance", "answer_start": 714}]}, {"question": "Who is Jennifer Conkie?", "id": "1999-W27-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Ms. McLachlan's lawyer", "answer_start": 1023}]}, {"question": "What is Canada's copyright law largely based on?", "id": "1999-W27-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the law in the United Kingdom", "answer_start": 1895}]}, {"question": "Why might it take months before a decision is made in this case?", "id": "1999-W27-3-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "because of the complexity of the case", "answer_start": 2231}]}, {"question": "When did Canada's copyright act come into effect?", "id": "1999-W27-3-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1924", "answer_start": 1865}]}], "context": "Lawyers for singer Sarah McLachlan and producer Daryl Neudorf were back in front of a judge yesterday in Vancouver, British Columbia. Mr. Neudorf is suing Ms. McLachlan for song writing credit and a share of money from her first album, recorded more than 10 years ago. The case has attracted international attention not only because of Sarah McLachlan's fame, but also because of the legal issues it raises. It is about what is called \"intellectual property\", or who owns ideas. Sarah McLachlan was 20 years old when she recorded the song Sad Clown and seven others on her debut album Touch. Daryl Neudorf claims he co-wrote four of those songs, including Sad Clown. On the album cover Mr. Neudorf is given credit for pre-production, coordination and production assistance. Ms. McLachlan even thanks him for inspiration. But nowhere is he given credit for co-writing. He was paid $3,385.00 for his work. The case all comes down to a question of his word against hers. \"What is the act of authorship,\" says Jennifer Conkie, Ms. McLachlan's lawyer, \"as opposed to all the other kinds of things musicians do in a jam session? That's a debated topic, I think, in the industry and certainly in the law.\" In the busy atmosphere of the recording studio, time is money. Songs are fine-tuned on the spot, and suggestions may come from producers or other musicians. The question is, where does working together end and co-writing begin? \"Usually there is an agreement in writing before they start to do work on a project,\" says Jonathon Simkin, Daryl Neudorf's lawyer. \"And that deals with everything from the royalty paid to how are we going to deal with the possibility that the producer might do some song writing.\" But when Touch was recorded, no such contracts were signed. Now the two are asking the court to sort it all out. Canada's copyright act came into effect in 1924, and is based largely on the law in the United Kingdom. But there have been few cases involving joint authorship. The judge in the McLachlan case, Justice Bruce Cohen, doesn't have many previous Canadian cases to guide him in his decision. The outcome of this lawsuit may become the example for future cases. Closing arguments are expected to wrap up today but because of the complexity of the case, it may be months before a decision is made."}]}, {"title": "Julie At Work", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why didn't Canadian astronaut Julie Payette get time to put on her red clown nose and listen to the Sarah McLaughlan CD she brought along with her on her shuttle flight", "id": "1999-W23-1-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "she was too busy getting the new International Space Station ready", "answer_start": 173}]}, {"question": "Who led the way into the unfinished station?", "id": "1999-W23-1-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "astronaut Tamara Jernigan and Russian crewmate Valery Tokarev", "answer_start": 616}]}, {"question": "Where was the temperature in the space station only 14 degrees?", "id": "1999-W23-1-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "inside the American Unity  Chamber", "answer_start": 1264}]}, {"question": "What did Valery Tokarev and Julie Payette change inside the Russian-built Zarya control module?", "id": "1999-W23-1-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "electrical meters on batteries that aren't charging properly", "answer_start": 1103}]}, {"question": "How did the crew reduce the noise level from fans inside Zarya?", "id": "1999-W23-1-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "insulation", "answer_start": 1642}]}, {"question": "What is the noise level in an office?", "id": "1999-W23-1-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "about 60 decibels", "answer_start": 1828}]}, {"question": "When are the first permanent residents due to arrive at the International Space Station?", "id": "1999-W23-1-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "next March", "answer_start": 2386}]}], "context": "Over the weekend Canadian astronaut Julie Payette did not get a lot of time to put on her red clown nose and listen to the Sarah McLaughlan CD she brought along.

But their welcome quickly gave way to work early today. Inside the Russian-built Zarya control module, Valery Tokarev and Canadian astronaut Julie Payette pulled up the floor and began changing electrical meters on batteries that aren't charging properly. Astronauts Rick Husband and Daniel Barry replaced two electronics boxes for a communication system inside the American Unity chamber, where it was a brisk 14 degrees. The system, which allows ground controllers to transmit and receive commands from the station, had been broken since mid-April but fired up quickly once the repairs were made. \"Your hard work has paid off!\" Mission Control radioed up. \"Well that's super news,\" Mr. Husband replied. Earlier, the crew installed insulation around some fans inside Zarya to reduce the noise level, which Mr. Barry said measured up to 67 decibels. Station officials hoped the mufflers would reduce the noise level to about 60 decibels -- about the same as an office environment. \"It is a little bit noisy in there.\" The National Aeronautics and Space Administration downplayed the multitude of problems coming so soon after the space station's launch. \"In high-tech like this, you're going to have that happen,\" Mission Control's Milt Heflin explains.

But the boy refuses to continue the treatment. Today, Judge A. R. Rothery ruled that Tyrell is influenced by his father, and cannot make an independent decision. The judge said the boy is misinformed, and that social services must now step in to help him.

He also believes that herbal and vitamin treatments at the Tijuana clinic will make him well again. Nanson said Tyrell s only source of information is his father, who won t permit his son to speak alone with a medical doctor. Nanson also said that Tyrell wouldn t think of disobeying his father.

Speaking through an interpreter, Sefa said he was happy to finally be in Winnipeg and offered his thanks to the Canadian people for opening their doors to him and his family. The six ethnic Albanian refugees - the first to make their way to Western Canada - will be staying with Sefa's brother Esat and his son Haki. \"This last month has been rough,\" Sefa said. \"We were not happy to leave our home, but we are glad to be here and safe.\" A month ago, Sefa, 59, and his family were given less than five minutes to leave their home in the town of Gjakov by Serb forces who ordered them out of Kosovo. The family took no clothes, mementos or household items with them and walked about seven kilometres to the Albanian border. While most of Sefa's family made the trip to the Albanian capital of Tirana safely, his youngest son, Orland, 23, never showed up. \"We don't know if he's alive or dead,\" Sefa said. Esat Sefa said he has been wanting to bring his family to Canada ever since fighting erupted in Kosovo. He said he often tried to send money and supplies to them but shipments were regularly intercepted by Serb forces who kept the money and goods for themselves. Sefa and his family will receive support from the federal government for up to two years, during which time they can apply to stay in Canada permanently. But Sefa - who recently retired from his job at a theatre after 45 years - said last night it may not take that long for him to decide where to make his new home. \"Maybe we stay here,\" he said as his wife gestured with a nod.

Ninety more refugees with relatives in Manitoba are expected to make their way to the province over the next month. At least 700 more ethnic Albanian refugees are expected in the coming weeks. Hundreds of thousands of refugees are now living in camps just outside of Yugoslavia. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees says those camps are almost full. Aid workers are doing their best to shepherd the refugees to camps that have space. Canada originally planned to take in 5,000 refugees and house them at Canadian Forces bases. But the UN decided it would be better to keep refugees closer to home to ease their return when the war ends. NEWS FLASH The federal government has reopened its plan to airlift 5,000 Kosovo Albanians to refuge in Canada. Canada put the airlift on hold three weeks ago when the UN decided it was better to keep ethnic Albanians driven from Kosovo by Serbian forces close to home. At that time, the UN figured it would be easier to resettle them when a peace deal is reached with Yugoslavia. Immigration Minister Lucienne Robillard says she was asked today to \"reactivate\" the plan by the United Nations agency responsible for refugees. And Ms. Robillard responded that Canada will do so.

The government wants to put graphic pictures and warnings on all cigarette packages. Allan Rock said yesterday that he's convinced the labels will work. But many of the young smokers he's targeting aren't so sure. The warnings cover half of each side of a cigarette package. There are 16 messages and images, including pictures of diseased lungs. Teenage smokers at a high school in Ottawa say some of the warnings are funny, but others, like an image showing a mouth full of rotting teeth, are disturbing and may make them think twice. \"I have to say this one with the teeth is quite disgusting. And I'm sure it will discourage a few smokers from starting up anyway,\" said one of the teens.

Just seeing it a warning label is going to gross you out every time you take a cigarette. It's not really going to stop you.\" But Rock believes the warnings will make a difference. He says his department has done extensive surveys and he thinks the labels will be effective. \"Our testing, our focus groups and our surveys demonstrated that the old style warnings are losing their force. It's important for us now to take fresh steps and that's what we're doing today.\" Anti-smoking organizations have applauded the strategy. The Non-Smokers Rights Association says the labels will give people a graphic reminder of the harmful effects of smoking a cigarette. But the plan has a very powerful enemy. The tobacco industry is considering whether it should take the government to court. The Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Association, which represents tobacco companies, says it would take two years and cost millions of dollars to change the packaging on Canadian cigarettes. Spokesman Rob Parker is convinced the warnings won't work. \"They're still doing the same old thing, yelling even louder at smokers to quit or non-smokers not to start.

The mudslides narrowly missed several cars and stranded hundreds of travelers. Heavy rains near the B.C. - Alberta border caused the slides. The mud was one metre deep in some areas of the road, and at its height covered all four lanes of the divided highway. After many hours of work, clean up crews were able to re-open the parts of the highway. Parks Canada say it will take several days before all the debris is cleared, and traffic returns to normal. Mudslides often occur in steep and mountainous areas. They are usually caused by weakened land on hills and mountains. Rivers, glaciers, heavy rainfall, melting snow, earthquakes, or even thunder can weaken the land. Once a slope is weakened, almost anything can start a mudslide. Rainstorms are a common cause of mudslides. In heavy storms, water soaks into the ground faster than it can run off. Water pressure loosens soil and rocks. When soil and rocks break loose, they become a mass of wet earth that starts a mudslide. Mudslides can move quickly and powerfully, picking up rocks, trees, houses and cars. As the debris moves into rivers, bridges can become blocked or even collapse, making a temporary dam that can flood neighbouring areas."}]}, {"title": "Uniforms and Strict Rules for Ontario Schools?", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who plans to institute a common code of conduct for students?", "id": "1999-W06-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the Ontario government", "answer_start": 146}]}, {"question": "How many students would the code affect?", "id": "1999-W06-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "2.1 million", "answer_start": 251}]}, {"question": "Under the code, what could happen to a student who swears at a teacher?", "id": "1999-W06-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "suspension", "answer_start": 1886}]}, {"question": "When is one time that schools will phone parents of students?", "id": "1999-W06-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "when the student is missing", "answer_start": 84}]}, {"question": "According to Johnson, how might a student's sloppy clothing affect them?", "id": "1999-W06-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "it could flow over into their learning habits and make it difficult to conduct proper teaching", "answer_start": 1321}]}], "context": "Students in Ontario may be wearing uniforms next fall, or dressing for school in clothes that conform to a province-wide dress code. It's part of the Ontario government's plan to introduce a common code of conduct by next September for the province's 2.1 million students from kindergarten to Grade 12. Ontario's Education Minister Dave Johnson said students, parents and teachers will all be asked to discuss their opinions about uniforms before any final decisions are made. \"Short of a common uniform, there may be a style of dress that may be appropriate within a school,\" Johnson said on Tuesday. \"There are many people in the province who feel that uniforms add a tone of authority and discipline to a school and make for a better learning environment.\" The common code of conduct has started with a new safety policy that requires schools to phone parents to find out why absent students are missing. The code would also deal with acceptable language and set out the punishment for students who smoke, destroy property, steal, distribute hate material or carry a weapon. These are still up for debate. Johnson believes stricter discipline at schools will produce students with better grades and young adults with responsible attitudes. \"If students are dressed in a sloppy manner, that kind of habit and dress may flow over into their learning habits and make it difficult to conduct proper teaching,\" he said. Ontario Premier Mike Harris, 54, believes the province's kids are not what they used to be. He said he remembers the times depicted in the 1950s TV sitcom, Leave it to Beaver. Harris, a former teacher and parent to two young boys, said students need to learn some respect. \"They need to know what the line is,\" he said Tuesday. \"What's acceptable and what isn't and that there are consequences for going over that line.\" Swearing at a teacher, for example, might mean suspension, Harris said. For violence, the punishment could be expulsion. Marshall Jarvis, head of the Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association, said schools already have policies in place to handle unruly students. \"The school is a microcosm of the society around it. There are students with serious concerns. However to paint a picture that that's a general trend across Ontario is not something that I've witnessed,\" he said."}]}, {"title": "Canada's Wartime Guests", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What happened in Europe and England when Geoffrey was nine years old?", "id": "1999-W08-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the Second World War began", "answer_start": 236}]}, {"question": "Where did Geoffrey Dewis live before he was nine?", "id": "1999-W08-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "England", "answer_start": 277}]}, {"question": "How many British children were evacuated under the Commonwealth child evacuation program?", "id": "1999-W08-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "over 2,600", "answer_start": 529}]}, {"question": "Why did CBC produce \"Canada Calling\"?", "id": "1999-W08-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "so that the British kids who were separated from their families could speak to their parents and friends back home over the airwaves", "answer_start": 1338}]}, {"question": "When did Geoffrey Dewis die?", "id": "1999-W08-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "this week", "answer_start": 0}]}, {"question": "Who published Dewis's obituary?", "id": "1999-W08-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the National Post", "answer_start": 10}]}], "context": "This week the National Post newspaper published an obituary of Geoffrey Dewis, a man who died in Vancouver at the age of 69.

His parents feared that Geoffrey and his older sister would be killed in the Nazi bombing of England. But there was a way to keep the kids safe. They took advantage of the Commonwealth child evacuation program.  Over 2,600 British children were sent to live with families in other Commonwealth countries where the war was not raging. Over half of those children -- 1530 of them -- came to live in Canada as guests. Some, like Geoffrey Dewis, returned to Canada to spend the rest of their lives. During the war, the trip to Canada was not easy.  German submarines lurked in the North Atlantic sea where the boats traveled. They fired torpedoes at British and Allied ships. Geoffrey Dewis's ship was the last to arrive safely at its destination.  The next boatload of British kids, on a ship called The City of Benares, was torpedoed and sank. Seventy-seven children on board died. Tragically, that was the end of the \"guest child\" program.

Many people come to visit Lunenburg because the town is a United Nations World Heritage Site. It's a distinction it shares with only one other Canadian city, Old Quebec. Lunenburg Harbour is famous for being the home of the Bluenose and the Bluenose II. The Bluenose was a famous schooner ship that raced for the International Fisherman's Trophy. The first International Fisherman's Trophy race was in 1920. It started as a friendly competition between US and Canadian fishing schooners. The Bluenose was one of the most successful racing schooners. The Bluenose won the race four times. In 1942, the Bluenose was sold to carry freight and cargo to the West Indies. In January 1946, it went down after striking a reef in the Caribbean Sea. In 1955, both the Bluenose and its captain, Angus Walters, were inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame for their achievements in the International Fisherman's Trophy races. A picture of the Bluenose has been on the tails side of Canadian dimes since 1937. The Bluenose II is a replica of the original Bluenose. It was built from the same plans, in the same shipyard, and by some of the same men who built the original. The Bluenose and Lunenburg are important parts of Canadian history.

Environment Canada is warning people in Ontario about a foreign fish called the round goby. The round goby is reducing precious sport fish stocks in the lake. This is important because sport fishing for small mouth bass, walleye and lake trout is a multi-million dollar industry. The round goby is about the size of a sardine. It is dangerous because it leaves almost no food for other fish. It eats the eggs and young of the sport fish and chases larger fish away from food sources, leaving little for them to eat. The round goby also has the advantage of being able to feed right through the night. It can do this because it has special sensors. The Fisheries and Oceans Department says the round goby makes life miserable for fishers too, because they steal bait and will also hit lures. In many cases, the fishermen are finding that all they can catch are goby. The round goby came from the Black Sea, likely in water held in the bottom of a boat. The fish is already well established in Lake Erie and Lake Superior. Officials hope to prevent it from spreading into other Canadian lakes and rivers. The Fisheries and Oceans Department says people can help control the goby population by not using the fish as bait, and by not transferring them from one body of water to another. Also, if they have a boat to make sure they clean off plants that might have small goby in them. The officials hope these measures will keep the round goby from taking over the waterways of central Canada."}]}, {"title": "Maple Leaf Gardens Closes its Doors", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What type of sports facility does Maple Leaf Gardens function as?", "id": "1999-W07-4-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a hockey rink", "answer_start": 30}]}, {"question": "When was the Maple Leaf Gardens built?", "id": "1999-W07-4-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1931", "answer_start": 3388}]}, {"question": "Where is the Maple Leaf Gardens?", "id": "1999-W07-4-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Toronto", "answer_start": 116}]}, {"question": "How far did Brent Shuya and his son have to drive just to reach Winnipeg?", "id": "1999-W07-4-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "3 and a half hours", "answer_start": 3290}]}, {"question": "When did Foster Hewitt start broadcasting Maple Leaf games on the radio?", "id": "1999-W07-4-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "March, 1923", "answer_start": 2961}]}, {"question": "Where did Tommy and Ruth sit for the Leaf's games at the Gardens?", "id": "1999-W07-4-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Grey Section West, Seats 13 and 14", "answer_start": 3264}]}, {"question": "Who was known as one of the toughest players in the NHL in the 1950s?", "id": "1999-W07-4-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Bill Juzda", "answer_start": 2318}]}], "context": "Maple Leaf Gardens. More than a hockey rink, it's a cultural institution. It may well be the strongest link between Toronto and the rest of Canada. And this weekend, the Gardens are losing the Maple Leafs. For thousands of people from coast to coast to coast, this Saturday is a special hockey night in Canada. It will be the last time the Leafs take to the ice at Maple Leaf Gardens. With the end in sight, the hype -- and mourning -- is beginning in earnest. More than one building in one city, the Gardens has long been a focal point for Canadian culture -- at least for anyone who has ever strapped on the blades. For decades, NHL games were broadcast into living rooms From Plum Coulee, Manitoba to Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia, and beyond from one of two places -- the Gardens or the Montreal Forum. With the end in sight, fond memories are starting to flow. In recent weeks, for example, hockey fans from Western Canada have been making the trek to Toronto to see one last game at the Gardens. Two weeks ago Brent Shuya and his son made the 3-and-a-half hour drive from their home in Russell, Manitoba to Winnipeg. There they hopped on an airplane for another two hour ride to Toronto.  The reason: to see their one and only hockey game at Maple Leaf Gardens. Brent says, \"it was pretty important to me, I wanted my son to go and visit the Gardens, seeing how they are not going to be playing there anymore. I've always been a Leaf fan probably since I was five or six years old and I guess I always will be whether they win or lose, and it was just nice to see them play in their old home.\" But Brent Shuya is by no means the only western hockey fan who has made one final pilgrimage to Maple Leaf Gardens. On his trip he met other fans from the Prairies doing the same thing. There is no one explanation as to why some fans outside Toronto feel such a strong attachment to the Leafs and the building in which they play, although radio and television have had much to do with it. Fans like Winnipeg businessman Jeff Thompson will be at the final game on Saturday. \"The Gardens and the Montreal Forum were both places that although we were never there, as kids growing up we were there,\" he says. \"They came into our house every weekend. It became larger than life because we had grown up watching it\". Winnipeger Bill Juzda was known as one of the toughest players in the NHL when he played for the Leafs in the 1950s. Mr. Juzda expects many of those at the final game Saturday will feel pretty much the way he did when he first walked into Maple Leaf Gardens nearly 50 years ago. He says, \"you walked in and you seen all those pictures in the lobby and everything else. And you stood outside and said, hey, I used to listen to Foster Hewitt on the radio and boy am I lucky to be here.\" Foster Hewitt was the Maple Leafs' radio broadcaster for decades. His voice was known by Canadians from coast to coast. He first broadcast a hockey game on the radio in March, 1923. Decades later he became the Leafs' first television announcer. In Toronto, many residents are sad to see the Leafs abandon the Gardens for the new Air Canada Centre. One fan is Tommy Gaston. For almost 60 years, the 82-year-old and his wife Ruth were in their seats for Leafs home games -- Grey Section West, Seats 13 and 14. After Saturday, the Gastons will have just their fond memories of the Gardens, built in 1931. But Gaston won't have trouble preserving his memories. A self-described pat rack, he has collected enough memorabilia to stock his basement -- and donate the overflow to the Hockey Hall of Fame."}]}, {"title": "No Union for Montreal McDonald's", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How many McDonald's restaurants are there in North America?", "id": "1999-W09-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "15,000", "answer_start": 1127}]}, {"question": "Where is the only unionized McDonald's in North America?", "id": "1999-W09-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Squamish, British Columbia", "answer_start": 186}]}, {"question": "When was the McDonald's unionized?", "id": "1999-W09-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "last August", "answer_start": 1210}]}, {"question": "What happened when the Teamsters tried to unionize a McDonald's in Montreal?", "id": "1999-W09-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "workers voted against becoming members of a trade union", "answer_start": 60}]}, {"question": "According to their Quebec office, how did McDonald's feel about the vote to unionize the Montreal franchise?", "id": "1999-W09-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "they welcomed the vote", "answer_start": 796}]}, {"question": "Why did the St-Hubert McDonald's not get unionized?", "id": "1999-W09-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "it got shut down just as the union was about to be certified", "answer_start": 1371}]}], "context": "Workers at a McDonald's restaurant in Montreal, Quebec have voted against becoming members of a trade union.

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters had been trying to organize the workers for 16 months. Rejean Lavigne, head of the Teamsters local behind the campaign, said almost all of the original employees who signed union cards in 1997 had quit and the new ones, some as young as 16, didn't want a union. \"If we lose, well, we can't do anything more,\" Lavigne said before the vote was tallied. \"If the employees don't want us there, what are you going to do?\" A statement from McDonald's Quebec regional office welcomed the vote. \"We believe that giving all the employees in the outlet the opportunity to determine the outcome of this matter was the fairest and most responsible way to resolve the question of union representation,\" the statement said. The McDonald's in Squamish became the first unionized outlet among the chain's more than 15,000 outlets in North America when the Canadian Auto Workers made a breakthrough last August. Rejection of the union in Montreal was the second failure for the Teamsters against the chain. Last year, a franchise in suburban St-Hubert, Quebec shut down just as the union was about to be certified. The latest loss means an end to a campaign begun last year to unionize at least one McDonald's in every major city across Canada, which has so far cost the Teamsters about $100,000. Union officials in Quebec say lengthy delays used by employers to fight certification played into McDonald's hands by discouraging its young employees. \"We received petitions saying thank you for the good work but we don't need you any more,\" Lavigne said. \"The workers fired us in effect.\""}]}, {"title": "Blaming the Seals", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How does Newfoundland intend to use a film of seals feasting on cod?", "id": "1999-W11-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "to increase the seal hunt", "answer_start": 58}]}, {"question": "Why has there been a moratorium on cod fishing?", "id": "1999-W11-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "fish stocks dropped to dangerous levels", "answer_start": 1218}]}, {"question": "When was the moratorium instituted?", "id": "1999-W11-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "1992", "answer_start": 1207}]}, {"question": "What is the estimated size of the seal herd?", "id": "1999-W11-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "six million", "answer_start": 1619}]}, {"question": "By how much does John Efford want to cut the seal herd?", "id": "1999-W11-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "in half", "answer_start": 1648}]}, {"question": "Where is Dalhousie University?", "id": "1999-W11-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Halifax, Nova Scotia", "answer_start": 1818}]}, {"question": "How much was sealing worth to the Newfoundland economy in 1996?", "id": "1999-W11-3-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "in excess of $11 million", "answer_start": 2447}]}], "context": "The Newfoundland government has a new weapon in its fight to increase the seal hunt: film of cod carnage.

Lloyd Oldford of Red Cliff, Bonavista Bay, a fisherman who first alerted Efford to the problem, said the video in no way shows the true extent of the destruction fishermen are seeing. \"I can show you 100 miles of it,\" said Oldford. \"There's nothing but dead fish in every crook and cranny. It's everywhere, massive destruction. It's taking away a great source of income from us. If we don't do something about this seal problem, more people are going to be leaving the province.\" John Efford, Newfoundland's fisheries minister, says the \"very disturbing\" images will wake up people to the toll seals are taking on northern cod stocks. There has been a moratorium - a temporary ban -  on fishing for cod since 1992 after fish stocks dropped to dangerous levels. \"We thought by bringing in the moratorium, that in a few years the cod stocks would start to return,\" he says. \"But seven years after the closure of the ground fish industry, stocks today are worse then they were previous to 1992. \"There's only one answer to that.... We've got an overpopulated seal herd.\" Mr. Efford says the seal herd, which is estimated at six million, needs to be cut in half. That would mean increasing the annual quota of 275,000 harp seals to between 475,000 and 575,000 animals. Jeff Hutchings, a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia says it is a stretch for Mr. Efford to use evidence of seals preying on cod in one location to argue for a massive cull (harvest) of the seal herd. \"The degree to which seals are retarding the recovery of cod stocks remains an open question. Maybe they are. Maybe they aren't.\" He adds that documentation of seals having eaten only the fish stomachs suggests scientists may have underestimated how many cod the seals kill. Researchers detect traces of fish in seal stomachs only if they eat the whole fish. Today, sealing comprises a vital part of Newfoundland's sluggish economy. In 1996 alone it was worth in excess of $11 million, with seal products being sold in Canada, Norway and Asia."}]}, {"title": "Surgical Dummies", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is a \"resident\"?", "id": "1999-W26-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a new doctor", "answer_start": 238}]}, {"question": "Where is Mt.

The senators were split 50-50 on the charge of obstruction of justice, and only 45 voted Clinton \"guilty\" on the charge of perjury. There are two parties in the Senate, the Democrats and the Republicans. The Republicans are the majority with 55 seats. They were for the impeachment, but in order to get 67 votes, they needed some of the Democrats to support them. The Democrats, however, felt that there wasn't enough public support to remove the president from office. And they were right. Although most Americans believe Clinton acted immorally, they don't think his actions were serious enough to impeach him. They grew very weary of the impeachment. In fact, Clinton's approval rating climbed during the trial, which means Americans think he is still fit to be their president. Clinton had denied having an affair with White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, but later admitted that he did have a relationship with her. It was his attempts to hide it that led to the charges against him. Republican senators claim Clinton tried to get Lewinsky to lie, but she says it was her own decision to cover up the affair. After the trial, Clinton said he was \"profoundly sorry\" for how he handled the situation."}]}, {"title": "A Step to Curing Diabetes", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How many Canadians have diabetes and don't realize it?", "id": "1999-W20-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "more than 750,00", "answer_start": 1183}]}, {"question": "What kinds of health problems do diabetics potentially face?", "id": "1999-W20-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "blindness, circulatory problems, heart disease and kidney failure", "answer_start": 757}]}, {"question": "How is diabetes currently controlled?", "id": "1999-W20-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "proper diet, exercise and insulin", "answer_start": 833}]}, {"question": "What does insulin do for our bodies?", "id": "1999-W20-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "helps the body properly use sugers", "answer_start": 1531}]}, {"question": "What do Type 1 diabetics' immune systems do to insulin-producing cells?", "id": "1999-W20-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "attacks them", "answer_start": 1471}]}, {"question": "Where does Dr. Yoon's team work?", "id": "1999-W20-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the University of Calgary", "answer_start": 239}]}, {"question": "Why will diabetics have to be patient, despite Dr. Ji-Won Yoon's discovery?", "id": "1999-W20-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a cure for humans is between five and 10 years away", "answer_start": 387}]}, {"question": "Who is Holly McWilliams?", "id": "1999-W20-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": " a diabetic", "answer_start": 1444}]}], "context": "A team of Calgary researchers says that they have discovered one of the causes of diabetes. The scientists have spent the last eight years in the lab trying to pinpoint the immune system's role in diabetes. Dr. Ji-Won Yoon and his team at the University of Calgary say their research gives insight into what triggers insulin-dependent diabetes. But, diabetics will have to be patient -- a cure for humans is between five and 10 years away. However, that didn't temper the enthusiasm of diabetic Holly McWilliams. \"This is very exciting,\" said the 18-year-old Calgarian who has had to inject insulin four times a day since she was three years old to stay alive. She now uses an insulin pump to maintain proper levels of the hormone. Diabetics are at risk of blindness, circulatory problems, heart disease and kidney failure, but with proper diet, exercise and insulin, it can be controlled. There are at least two strands of diabetes: Type 1 -- when the body doesn't produce insulin. Type 2 -- when insulin in the body doesn't work properly. Dr. Ji-Won Yoon's discovery affects Type 1 diabetics, which inflicts about 100,000 Canadians. One and a half million Canadians have diabetes; more than 750,000 have it and don't know it. \"This is a major landmark study and it helps us understand the disease in a way we haven't in the past,\" says Dr. David Lau of the Julia McFarlane Diabetes Research Centre. Dr. Yoon's research on mice focuses on how a diabetic's immune system attacks cells that produce insulin, which is needed to help the body properly use sugars. A protein in the pancreas, which produces insulin, plays a critical role in triggering diabetes in mice. Destruction of insulin-producing cells by the immune system can be prevented by halting protein production. Dr. Yoon said his work could lead to transplants of tissue that fight the sugar build-up process or possibly a vaccine. Lau is confident studies on mice will also work on humans."}]}, {"title": "Last Eclipse of the Millennium Arrives", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "For whom did the last solar eclipse of the millennium brighten the morning?", "id": "1999-W33-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "millions of people in Europe", "answer_start": 68}]}, {"question": "What causes a solar eclipse?", "id": "1999-W33-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the moon passes between the Earth and the sun", "answer_start": 376}]}, {"question": "Where did the path of the moon's shadow begin?", "id": "1999-W33-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "in the Atlantic", "answer_start": 507}]}, {"question": "What is a total eclipse?", "id": "1999-W33-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the moon totally blocks the sun", "answer_start": 775}]}, {"question": "How many times can an eclipse occur in one year?", "id": "1999-W33-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "seven", "answer_start": 635}]}, {"question": "Why was this eclipse special?", "id": "1999-W33-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "it was a total eclipse", "answer_start": 745}]}, {"question": "How long do total eclipses last?", "id": "1999-W33-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a few minutes", "answer_start": 456}]}, {"question": "If an astronomer observed every total solar eclipse for twenty-five years, how much total eclipse time would he actually watch?", "id": "1999-W33-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "only about an hour of total eclipses", "answer_start": 954}]}, {"question": "Where could a partial eclipse be seen?", "id": "1999-W33-3-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Eastern Canada", "answer_start": 1141}]}, {"question": "What is a partial eclipse?", "id": "1999-W33-3-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "the moon covers part, but not all of the sun", "answer_start": 1078}]}], "context": "The last solar eclipse of the millennium brightened the morning for millions of people in Europe on Wednesday.

The minimum number of eclipses there can be in one year is two. What made this eclipse special is that it was a total eclipse, where the moon totally blocks the sun.

Last Thursday CBC4Kids explained why Saskatchewan Judge A. R. Rothery would not allow Tyrell to refuse cancer treatment. Justice Rothery said that it was in Tyrell's best interest to continue with chemotherapy even if he and his family were opposed. Tyrell was examined by doctors in Saskatoon on Friday. They were getting ready to follow the judge's orders and continue treating Tyrell. Instead the doctors discovered that cancer has spread from Tyrell's leg into his lungs. It has all but ended his chance of recovery. \"Tyrell's legal battles are over. The matter is most certainly in the hands of God, if it ever were in the hands of mortals,\" the Duecks' lawyer Owe Girths told a stunned crowd of supporters on Sunday. Doctors have told Tyrell they can do nothing more for him. He spent a quiet weekend at home as his family considered what to do now. \"He is suffering with some pain in his knee. The doctors have given him some pain control for that but he maintains the quiet confidence in his God that he has had since the beginning of this thing,\" Mr. Girths said. Tyrell first discovered a lump on his leg around his birthday, October 1, after he slipped in the shower. Bone cancer was diagnosed. He and his family fought to avoid standard cancer therapy, consisting of chemotherapy and at least the partial amputation of his leg. Chemotherapy consists of putting various chemicals into the body to destroy the cancer. The Dueck family are fundamentalist Christians and wanted to send the boy to Mexico for alternative treatment, which would include herbs and large doses of vitamins, and rely on the power of prayer. Saskatchewan's Social Services Department went to court twice to force the boy to submit to traditional treatment. Last week, a judge ordered Tyrell to resume treatment but the family planned to appeal. But none of that matters with the new diagnosis. Saskatchewan Social Services was to go to court this week to lift all the orders involving the boy's treatment. The boy's doctor has said only 10 per cent of patients survive with his form of cancer, a rare osteosarcoma, once it has moved into the lungs. Mr. Griffiths said Tyrell's parents Tim and Yvonne no longer harbour anger about being dragged through the courts while their son's illness worsened. \"There was perhaps momentary resentment but there is no longer any resentment on their part. They believe that this has all unfolded as God would have it unfold,\" says Mr. Griffiths. Other family members who heard yesterday's announcement weren't so sure. \"I think Tyrell would not be in the situation he is today if Social Services had not stepped in two months ago,\" said Kevin Hildebrandt, Tyrell's uncle."}]}, {"title": "Scientists Hope to Clone Mammoth", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where was a mummified wooly mammoth found?", "id": "1999-W30-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "Siberia", "answer_start": 219}]}, {"question": "Who is going to dig up the dead wooly mammoth?", "id": "1999-W30-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "a group of international scientists", "answer_start": 157}]}, {"question": "How do scientists hope to create an exact duplicate of the mammoth?", "id": "1999-W30-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "through cloning techniques", "answer_start": 445}]}, {"question": "Why is it important that the the colour of the mammoth's hair and the smell of the skin are still present?", "id": "1999-W30-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "This means the hair or skin may still contain the DNA needed for the cloning experiment", "answer_start": 664}]}, {"question": "When did the wooly mammoth live?", "id": "1999-W30-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "23,000 years ago", "answer_start": 99}]}, {"question": "What modern animals do wooly mammoths look most like?", "id": "1999-W30-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": [{"text": "modern-day Asian elephants", "answer_start": 782}]}], "context": "It sounds like the story from the dinosaur movie Jurassic Park.

The scientists say the colour of the mammoth's hair is still present, as is the smell of the skin. This means the hair or skin may still contain the DNA needed for the cloning experiment. Mammoths are most similar to modern-day Asian elephants. An elephant is expected to act as the host or mother of the mammoth when it is created.

Various levels of government will give millions of dollars to the teams in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver to help them stay in business. The money will come from taxpayers. NHL teams like the Ottawa Senators and the Edmonton Oilers have said for years that they are going broke. They have threatened to move to the United States - where they say business is better - unless the government helps them out. Yesterday Industry Minister John Manley finally agreed. He has given the go-ahead to negotiate subsidies (money given to help out) on a team-by-team basis. Some teams will get more. Others will get less. The subsidies could add up to millions of dollars. The reaction to the program has been very mixed. In the Montreal Canadiens dressing room, winger Turner Stevenson of Prince George, British Columbia, is very happy. \"People see it as the government giving us free money, but look how much tax we pay,\" he says. \"Guys make a million, but they pay half of that in taxes.\" The average NHL player makes 1.3 million dollars a season. But Olympic 100 metre sprinter Glenroy Gilbert is disgusted.

He believes Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms means that Canadians are free to beg if they want to. The Charter sets out the laws that govern the legal rights of Canadian citizens. Sean's launching a Charter challenge against Ottawa's anti-panhandling laws after he was ticketed for begging on the street. Sean used to beg on a patch of downtown Ottawa sidewalk, wedged between a bank and a grocery store. He sat on the ground, silent, with a hat in front of him. Police often asked him to move. In March, he got a $50 ticket -- and decided to take it to court. This is the first time an individual has challenged begging laws in court. It could be a landmark case, one with consequences for a number of Canadian cities that restrict or ban panhandling. \"What I was doing wasn't wrong, there was nothing wrong with it. I wasn't harassing anyone. And I think I live in a place where people have the right to give charity first-hand,\" Sean told Carla Hilton, a reporter for CBC radio news. Lawyer Mark Ertle plans to challenge the law on two counts -- it restricts freedom of expression, and security of the person, individual freedoms guaranteed under the Charter. \"You can understand that the police would see it was sort of fruitless to charge people who are begging with an offence for which they're going to receive a fine, which they can never pay anyway. And so while a lot of people aren't charged, I think the police do use the law to clear the streets,\" Mr. Ertle says. Here's what the Charter says: Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms: Freedom of conscience and religion; Freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication; Freedom of peaceful assembly; and Freedom of association. The Charter guarantees certain freedoms for everyone in Canada. Under section 2 of the Charter, Canadians are guaranteed freedom of thought, belief and expression. Since the media are an important means for communicating thoughts and ideas, the Charter also protects the right of the press and other media to speak out. Canadian traditions and laws have reflected the freedoms set out in section 2 for many years. Since 1982, the Charter has given these freedoms constitutional protection. These freedoms are set out in the Charter to ensure that Canadians are free to create and to express their ideas, gather to discuss them and communicate them widely to other people. These activities are basic forms of individual liberty. They are also important to the success of a democratic society like Canada. In a democracy, people must be free to discuss matters of public policy, criticize governments and offer their own solutions to social problems. Even though these freedoms are very important, governments can sometimes limit them. For example, laws against pornography and hate propaganda are reasonable limits on freedom of expression because they prevent harm to individuals and groups. Sean's court case is still a few weeks away. But people with an interest in issues like democratic rights and poverty are watching the Ottawa case closely. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the National Anti-Poverty Organization have both expressed interest in going before the court to explain their positions."}]}]}
