But the Kolla brothers' cool heads, backwoods savvy and faith in themselves saw them through to celebrate the younger boy's birthday. Earlier this week they described how they did it. \"We had faith that we could pull through it and we kept our cool and didn't panic,\" said A.J. Kolla, who celebrated his 14th birthday on Tuesday, two days after he and his brother were caught out overnight at the Schweitzer Mountain Ski Resort in Sandpoint, Idaho. The ordeal began Saturday morning, when the boys took a wrong turn heading back to the resort chalet. The boys were skiing by themselves while their father attended a veterinary conference. The two kept heading downhill, but when they reached a riverbank around 4 p.m., they realized they were lost and decided to head back uphill to try to regain their way. \"When we were hiking back and it was starting to get dark, we realized 'Oh oh, we're going to be here for a while,'\" said A.J. Using their hands, the two dug into the snow hollow around the base of a tree, covered the floor with pine boughs and settled in for a long, cold night. \"We slept in shifts, 'cause it was very cold and we were very wet,\" said Michael, 15. The two conserved heat by crossing their arms over their chests and pressing up back-to-back. Wiggling their toes to keep out frostbite, they talked about getting home and eating. \"A.J. kept talking about a strudel that was left at the hotel,\" said Michael. \"I had a dream that we all of sudden stumbled across a fort or a hut, and it was warm and we had tons of food.\" Meanwhile, a blizzard outside the shelter was dumping 45 centimetres of snow and whipping it around with 110-kilometres-an-hour winds. The weather was so bad that the search parties were called in and the search called off. Shortly after 6 a.m., there was enough light for the boys to start hiking back again. But after four hours of post-holing uphill through snow up to their waists, they were too tired to continue. They dug a cave into a snowbank, crossed Michael's skis out front in case a helicopter flew over, and went inside to rest. \"A.J. was lying there and shivering and I'd always be thinking, `It's a helicopter,'\" Michael said. After a rest, they set out again and soon came to the cross-country ski trail where they were found by a party of snowmobilers. They had no frostbite or hypothermia. \"The ski patrol helped us out, first aid, got some food, and that's about all,\" shrugged A.J. Father Michael Kolla was at the resort after a sleepless night when he got the word the boys were safe and sound. \"I was just ecstatic,\" he recalls. \"We were in a circle and jumping around and hugging each other.\" His wife Carol was on a plane flying to Sandpoint when a message came back from the pilot saying: \"Boys found. Under observation.\" \"Then we just had a great drive up to Schweitzer,\" she said, her voice shaking. \"We were so happy.\" The family credits winter camping tips from a friend for saving the boys' lives. Although they'd never slept out in one before, Michael and A.J. had built snow shelters many times in their backyard. \"They knew if they built these things they'd stay warm,\" said Carol. \"They helped my boys live.\" The boys soon figured they would have to stick together to survive. \"At the start when we were just lost, we were kind of snappy at each other, but by the end we were encouraging each other, saying `You can do it,' \" said Michael. \"When we were on the mountain I just thought that we've got to keep our heads on and keep ourselves together and encourage each other and that's what ending up happening.\" When will they hit the hill next? \"Soon as possible, I guess,\" said Michael."}]}, {"title": "President Clinton Acquitted in Trial", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What does \"perjury\" mean?", "id": "1999-W08-1-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How many senators voted that President Clinton was guilty of perjury?", "id": "1999-W08-1-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When was Clinton acquitted of the charges of perjury and obstructing justice?", "id": "1999-W08-1-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where did Monica Lewinsky work as an intern?", "id": "1999-W08-1-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who claimed that Clinton tried to get Lewinsky to lie about her affair with the president?", "id": "1999-W08-1-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What happened to Clinton's approval ratings during the impeachment trial?", "id": "1999-W08-1-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "The trial of the American president ended Friday when he was found not guilty of both charges against him. President Clinton was acquitted of the charge of perjury (lying in court) and of obstructing justice (hiding evidence, or getting others to lie in court). Both are very serious offences. If found guilty, Clinton would have been removed as president of the United States. The Senate, which is made up of 100 senators, needed 67 votes to impeach Clinton on either charge. The senators were split 50-50 on the charge of obstruction of justice, and only 45 voted Clinton \"guilty\" on the charge of perjury. There are two parties in the Senate, the Democrats and the Republicans. The Republicans are the majority with 55 seats. They were for the impeachment, but in order to get 67 votes, they needed some of the Democrats to support them. The Democrats, however, felt that there wasn't enough public support to remove the president from office. And they were right. Although most Americans believe Clinton acted immorally, they don't think his actions were serious enough to impeach him. They grew very weary of the impeachment. In fact, Clinton's approval rating climbed during the trial, which means Americans think he is still fit to be their president. Clinton had denied having an affair with White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, but later admitted that he did have a relationship with her. It was his attempts to hide it that led to the charges against him. Republican senators claim Clinton tried to get Lewinsky to lie, but she says it was her own decision to cover up the affair. After the trial, Clinton said he was \"profoundly sorry\" for how he handled the situation."}]}, {"title": "NASA Refuses to Launch Canadian Satellite", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How can the satellite help farmers?", "id": "1999-W08-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why might the Canadian government have to get someone else beside NASA to launch the satellite for them?", "id": "1999-W08-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who is concerned about Radarsat-2's powerful abilities?", "id": "1999-W08-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who is the director of strategic development for the Canadian Space Agency?", "id": "1999-W08-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "A new Canadian radar satellite sees too much, too clearly, according to NASA, the American space agency.

The goal is to show some wayward Inuit the traditional ways. On a typical day in this northern community, a hunting party is about to head out. This one includes two prisoners from the Baffin Correctional Centre (BCC), both convicted of assault, both trying to reconnect with Inuit traditions and culture. Moshe Akavak, a guard with the BCC says learning the traditional ways will help the prisoners' rehabilitation. \"If they go out, they keep themselves busy doing hunting, repairing equipment, it's good for them.\" The party is hunting caribou, far from the city on the frozen tundra. Michael Evic is serving a two-year sentence for assault and other crimes. Out on the tundra with the hunting party he aims at his prey with a high powered rifle. His first shot misses. He tries again. This time he's successful. Inuit believe it takes more than killing an animal to become a hunter. What happens afterwards is just as important. Part of the instruction is learning how to carefully skin and carve a caribou the way Inuit have always done it. When Moshe Akavak became a jail guard 16 years ago, he was appalled so many Inuit had lost their traditional skills. He believes that's why some became criminals. \"Anything they learn from the land program, or from other people, of course, they will be willing to pass on to their children.\" He says over the years hundreds of prisoners have been given guns and knives and taught how to use them. There's never been a problem. \"The more you trust other people, you also gain it back.\" This is just one of the traditional hunting programs for prisoners. In the summer they go after seals. Depending on how well they do they could be sent to an outpost camp where they'll hunt and fish for months at a time. It's all very expensive, costing tens of thousands of dollars for equipment, clothing and supervision. But many believe it's money well spent. \"Whenever you have inmates that come out of jail feeling good about themselves and wanting to succeed I think that cost is well borne out in terms of perhaps reduced recidivism [a return to committing crimes].  And I think you have the chance for these people to return to their communities and contribute,\" says John McKnight, warden of the centre. The prisoners, like Michael Evic, believe learning traditional hunting skills will straighten out their lives. \"I'll just keep on working and go hunting on weekends and keep out of booze or drugs, that was my problem,\" Evic says."}]}, {"title": "Is Panhandling a Right?", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where did Sean use to do his panhandling?", "id": "1999-W20-4-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When was Sean fined for begging?", "id": "1999-W20-4-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who is Sean's lawyer?", "id": "1999-W20-4-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What kinds of laws have governments passed that limit the freedom of expression?", "id": "1999-W20-4-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "Sean O'Neill says its his right to ask you for money -- and he's going to court to prove it. He believes Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms means that Canadians are free to beg if they want to. The Charter sets out the laws that govern the legal rights of Canadian citizens. Sean's launching a Charter challenge against Ottawa's anti-panhandling laws after he was ticketed for begging on the street. Sean used to beg on a patch of downtown Ottawa sidewalk, wedged between a bank and a grocery store. He sat on the ground, silent, with a hat in front of him. Police often asked him to move. In March, he got a $50 ticket -- and decided to take it to court. This is the first time an individual has challenged begging laws in court. It could be a landmark case, one with consequences for a number of Canadian cities that restrict or ban panhandling. \"What I was doing wasn't wrong, there was nothing wrong with it. I wasn't harassing anyone. And I think I live in a place where people have the right to give charity first-hand,\" Sean told Carla Hilton, a reporter for CBC radio news. Lawyer Mark Ertle plans to challenge the law on two counts -- it restricts freedom of expression, and security of the person, individual freedoms guaranteed under the Charter. \"You can understand that the police would see it was sort of fruitless to charge people who are begging with an offence for which they're going to receive a fine, which they can never pay anyway. And so while a lot of people aren't charged, I think the police do use the law to clear the streets,\" Mr. Ertle says. Here's what the Charter says: Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms: Freedom of conscience and religion; Freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication; Freedom of peaceful assembly; and Freedom of association. The Charter guarantees certain freedoms for everyone in Canada. Under section 2 of the Charter, Canadians are guaranteed freedom of thought, belief and expression. Since the media are an important means for communicating thoughts and ideas, the Charter also protects the right of the press and other media to speak out. Canadian traditions and laws have reflected the freedoms set out in section 2 for many years. Since 1982, the Charter has given these freedoms constitutional protection. These freedoms are set out in the Charter to ensure that Canadians are free to create and to express their ideas, gather to discuss them and communicate them widely to other people. These activities are basic forms of individual liberty. They are also important to the success of a democratic society like Canada. In a democracy, people must be free to discuss matters of public policy, criticize governments and offer their own solutions to social problems. Even though these freedoms are very important, governments can sometimes limit them. For example, laws against pornography and hate propaganda are reasonable limits on freedom of expression because they prevent harm to individuals and groups. Sean's court case is still a few weeks away. But people with an interest in issues like democratic rights and poverty are watching the Ottawa case closely. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the National Anti-Poverty Organization have both expressed interest in going before the court to explain their positions."}]}, {"title": "The War in Yugoslavia is Officially Over", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who is the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)?", "id": "1999-W26-1-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "As part of the peace deal with the KLA, what have KLA members agreed to do?", "id": "1999-W26-1-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where are ethnic Albanian refugees living?", "id": "1999-W26-1-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When did the G8 meet to come up with a plan to rebuild the war-torn region of Yugoslavia?", "id": "1999-W26-1-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How much could it cost to rebuild from the damage caused by NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia?", "id": "1999-W26-1-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why is a democratic society in Kosovo essential, according to Lloyd Axworthy?", "id": "1999-W26-1-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "Now that the Yugoslavian army has completely withdrawn from the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo, NATO's military campaign in Yugoslavia is officially over. Over the weekend, NATO authorities also reached a peace deal with the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), a group of Yugoslavians of Albanian heritage who were fighting against the Yugoslavian army. The deal says that KLA members will hand over their large weapons to NATO forces and stop wearing military uniforms. Now the war-torn region in eastern Europe is faced with the enormous task of rebuilding and overcoming the ethnic hatred that started the conflict. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians are still in refugee camps in the countries surrounding Yugoslavia. Thousands of others are refugees in countries around the world, including Canada. These people must now make the decision if - or when - they will go home. Thousands of Yugolsavians of Serbian heritage have now been chased from Kosovo by the people of Albanian heritage who have returned. One of the major questions is this: what will happen to those Serbs who decide to remain in Kosovo? Will Albanians and Serbs be able to live together in peace? The NATO bombing of Yugoslavia destroyed hundreds of roads, bridges, factories, oil refineries, electric generating plants and office buildings. Many thousands of people were killed - both by the NATO bombs and by Serbian soldiers. It could cost more than a hundred billion dollars to rebuild what NATO destroyed in Yugoslavia. Over the weekend the leaders of the world's eight leading industrialized countries, known as the Group of Eight or the G8, met in Cologne, Germany. The G8 countries are: Germany, The United States, Canada, Japan, Russia, France, Britain, and Italy. At the top of the agenda was coming up with a plan to rebuild the region and make sure that a lasting peace can be maintained. Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs says the peace process will make an effort to \"democratize\" Kosovo, aiming for eventual elections. A civilian administration will likely look after this end of business. \"I don't think there's any doubt that we want to see a democratic society there -- that's the only way that you're going to bring ultimate peace, stability and reconstruction to the area,\" says Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy. \"I think that those processes are under way already in Serbia. I think that you'll be seeing a new political dynamic emerging in that region.\" Over the next few days, weeks and months, the world will also be watching to see what happens with Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic, who is still in power. One thing appears certain -- Milosevic will not be leaving Yugoslavia. He has been charged with war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal. The Tribunal is trying to arrest people who have broken international humanitarian law. If Mr. Milosevic tries to leave Yugoslavia he could be arrested and taken to court in The Hague, The Netherlands, where the court is located. And there he would be put on trial. If he was found guilty he could spend many, many years in jail."}]}, {"title": "Who Wrote Sarah's Songs?", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why is producer Daryl Neudorf suing singer Sarah McLachlan?", "id": "1999-W27-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where is this case being tried?", "id": "1999-W27-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What does Neudorf claim about the eight songs on Sarah McLachlan's first album?", "id": "1999-W27-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How is Neudorf given credit on the album cover?", "id": "1999-W27-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who is Jennifer Conkie?", "id": "1999-W27-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What is Canada's copyright law largely based on?", "id": "1999-W27-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why might it take months before a decision is made in this case?", "id": "1999-W27-3-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When did Canada's copyright act come into effect?", "id": "1999-W27-3-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "Lawyers for singer Sarah McLachlan and producer Daryl Neudorf were back in front of a judge yesterday in Vancouver, British Columbia. Mr. Neudorf is suing Ms. McLachlan for song writing credit and a share of money from her first album, recorded more than 10 years ago. The case has attracted international attention not only because of Sarah McLachlan's fame, but also because of the legal issues it raises. It is about what is called \"intellectual property\", or who owns ideas. Sarah McLachlan was 20 years old when she recorded the song Sad Clown and seven others on her debut album Touch. Daryl Neudorf claims he co-wrote four of those songs, including Sad Clown. On the album cover Mr. Neudorf is given credit for pre-production, coordination and production assistance. Ms. McLachlan even thanks him for inspiration. But nowhere is he given credit for co-writing. He was paid $3,385.00 for his work. The case all comes down to a question of his word against hers. \"What is the act of authorship,\" says Jennifer Conkie, Ms. McLachlan's lawyer, \"as opposed to all the other kinds of things musicians do in a jam session? That's a debated topic, I think, in the industry and certainly in the law.\" In the busy atmosphere of the recording studio, time is money. Songs are fine-tuned on the spot, and suggestions may come from producers or other musicians. The question is, where does working together end and co-writing begin? \"Usually there is an agreement in writing before they start to do work on a project,\" says Jonathon Simkin, Daryl Neudorf's lawyer. \"And that deals with everything from the royalty paid to how are we going to deal with the possibility that the producer might do some song writing.\" But when Touch was recorded, no such contracts were signed. Now the two are asking the court to sort it all out. Canada's copyright act came into effect in 1924, and is based largely on the law in the United Kingdom. But there have been few cases involving joint authorship. The judge in the McLachlan case, Justice Bruce Cohen, doesn't have many previous Canadian cases to guide him in his decision. The outcome of this lawsuit may become the example for future cases. Closing arguments are expected to wrap up today but because of the complexity of the case, it may be months before a decision is made."}]}, {"title": "Tyrell Dueck mourned at funeral", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where was Tyrell Dueck from?", "id": "1999-W28-1-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What was wrong with Tyrell before he died?", "id": "1999-W28-1-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What kind of treatment did Tyrell and his parents want to try for his condition?", "id": "1999-W28-1-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why did the Saskatchewan government take Tyrell's case to the court of law?", "id": "1999-W28-1-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How long was Tyrell's treatment delayed while the case went through the courts?", "id": "1999-W28-1-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When did the provincal government drop the case against Tyrell?", "id": "1999-W28-1-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who claimed that Tyrell didn't have cancer?", "id": "1999-W28-1-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "According to Joe Bourgeault, why did the alternative medicine fail to work in Tyrell's case?", "id": "1999-W28-1-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "Funeral services were held over the weekend for Tyrell Dueck.

Instead they decided to use herbal, and alternative treatments that included large doses of vitamins and a special diet. The Saskatchewan government didn't think alternative medicine would work, and felt Tyrell's parents were pressuring him to refuse traditional medicine. The province went to court to force him to undergo surgery for the cancer in his leg. Tyrell waited three months for treatment as his case went through the courts. When it was discovered the cancer had spread to Tyrell's lungs, the province dropped the case. Shortly after, Tyrell's parents took the boy to Mexico for the alternative treatment.

It is not known what causes the disease, but it is known that cells in one half of the brain become inflamed, or puffy when infected. As a result, the affected brain cells malfunction, and fire off electrical energy when they are not supposed to. This energy causes epileptic seizures. Seizures cause a violent jerking of the arms and legs, and are difficult to control with medication. Amber had the left side of her brain removed.

Environment Canada is warning people in Ontario about a foreign fish called the round goby. The round goby is reducing precious sport fish stocks in the lake. This is important because sport fishing for small mouth bass, walleye and lake trout is a multi-million dollar industry. The round goby is about the size of a sardine. It is dangerous because it leaves almost no food for other fish. It eats the eggs and young of the sport fish and chases larger fish away from food sources, leaving little for them to eat. The round goby also has the advantage of being able to feed right through the night. It can do this because it has special sensors. The Fisheries and Oceans Department says the round goby makes life miserable for fishers too, because they steal bait and will also hit lures. In many cases, the fishermen are finding that all they can catch are goby. The round goby came from the Black Sea, likely in water held in the bottom of a boat. The fish is already well established in Lake Erie and Lake Superior. Officials hope to prevent it from spreading into other Canadian lakes and rivers. The Fisheries and Oceans Department says people can help control the goby population by not using the fish as bait, and by not transferring them from one body of water to another. Also, if they have a boat to make sure they clean off plants that might have small goby in them. The officials hope these measures will keep the round goby from taking over the waterways of central Canada."}]}, {"title": "Nova Scotia elects a new government", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where were elections for premier held?", "id": "1999-W31-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who is Russell MacLellan?", "id": "1999-W31-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How many seats in the legislature did the Progressive Conservatives win in the election?", "id": "1999-W31-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What does it mean to have a minority government?", "id": "1999-W31-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How did the PC party place in the last election?", "id": "1999-W31-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "By when has Hamm promised to cut people's taxes?", "id": "1999-W31-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why was Russell MacLellan forced to call an election?", "id": "1999-W31-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What does it mean when the government is defeated on a major bill?", "id": "1999-W31-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What must a premier do when there is a vote of non-confidence?", "id": "1999-W31-3-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "John Hamm has been elected the new Premier of Nova Scotia. Hamm is the leader of the Nova Scotia Progressive Conservative Party. The PC party defeated both the Liberal Party government led by Premier Russell MacLellan and Robert Chisholm's New Democratic Party. The election was not as close as many experts thought it would be. The Conservatives were able to win a majority government, meaning they will have more members in the legislature than both parties combined. The Conservatives won 29 seats, the New Democrats 12 and the Liberals 11. After the last election Nova Scotia had a minority government. That means that no one party had more than half the seats in the legislature. Hamm has promised to cut people's taxes within three years. He also plans to reduce the number of government workers. Hamm is a 61-year-old doctor with only six years of political experience. His majority win was a comeback for the PC Party. The party placed third in the last election. Liberal leader Russell MacLellan was forced to call the election after the other parties voted against his budget. When the government is defeated on a major bill, like one that is about money, it means the legislature has lost confidence in them. This vote of non-confidence means the premier must either quit, or call a new election. MacLellan decided to call a new election.

He was considered an authority on craters and the collisions that cause them. He is credited with discovering about 20 comets and 800 asteroids. Shoemaker gained worldwide fame in 1994, when he helped discover the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. The comet slammed into Jupiter in 1994. It was always Shoemaker's dream to go to the moon.

After many hours of work, clean up crews were able to re-open the parts of the highway. Parks Canada say it will take several days before all the debris is cleared, and traffic returns to normal. Mudslides often occur in steep and mountainous areas. They are usually caused by weakened land on hills and mountains. Rivers, glaciers, heavy rainfall, melting snow, earthquakes, or even thunder can weaken the land. Once a slope is weakened, almost anything can start a mudslide. Rainstorms are a common cause of mudslides. In heavy storms, water soaks into the ground faster than it can run off. Water pressure loosens soil and rocks. When soil and rocks break loose, they become a mass of wet earth that starts a mudslide. Mudslides can move quickly and powerfully, picking up rocks, trees, houses and cars. As the debris moves into rivers, bridges can become blocked or even collapse, making a temporary dam that can flood neighbouring areas."}]}, {"title": "Last Eclipse of the Millennium Arrives", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "For whom did the last solar eclipse of the millennium brighten the morning?", "id": "1999-W33-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What causes a solar eclipse?", "id": "1999-W33-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where did the path of the moon's shadow begin?", "id": "1999-W33-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What is a total eclipse?", "id": "1999-W33-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How many times can an eclipse occur in one year?", "id": "1999-W33-3-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why was this eclipse special?", "id": "1999-W33-3-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How long do total eclipses last?", "id": "1999-W33-3-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "If an astronomer observed every total solar eclipse for twenty-five years, how much total eclipse time would he actually watch?", "id": "1999-W33-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where could a partial eclipse be seen?", "id": "1999-W33-3-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What is a partial eclipse?", "id": "1999-W33-3-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "The last solar eclipse of the millennium brightened the morning for millions of people in Europe on Wednesday.

Many people come to visit Lunenburg because the town is a United Nations World Heritage Site. It's a distinction it shares with only one other Canadian city, Old Quebec. Lunenburg Harbour is famous for being the home of the Bluenose and the Bluenose II. The Bluenose was a famous schooner ship that raced for the International Fisherman's Trophy. The first International Fisherman's Trophy race was in 1920. It started as a friendly competition between US and Canadian fishing schooners. The Bluenose was one of the most successful racing schooners. The Bluenose won the race four times. In 1942, the Bluenose was sold to carry freight and cargo to the West Indies. In January 1946, it went down after striking a reef in the Caribbean Sea. In 1955, both the Bluenose and its captain, Angus Walters, were inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame for their achievements in the International Fisherman's Trophy races. A picture of the Bluenose has been on the tails side of Canadian dimes since 1937. The Bluenose II is a replica of the original Bluenose. It was built from the same plans, in the same shipyard, and by some of the same men who built the original. The Bluenose and Lunenburg are important parts of Canadian history. This is why the sewage is a concern. The Mayor says the federal government agreed to help maintain the area when Lunenburg applied for UN World Heritage Site status. Now the Mayor wants the federal and provincial governments to pay half the cost of cleaning up Lunenburg Harbour. The Mayor says increasing people's taxes to pay for the cleanup is not the answer.

Magnitude measures the amount of energy released by an earthquake. An observatory in Istanbul said more than 250 aftershocks followed the first tremor. Aftershocks are vibrations that follow an earthquake. Officials have warned people not to return to buildings with even some sign of structural damage, for fear there may be more collapses.

A new study shows Canadian kids are spending almost one full day a week glued to their television screens. And many doctors think there are several reasons why too much TV is not good for kids. A group representing Canadian pediatricians - doctors who specialize in treating children - may have a new question for parents when they take their children for a checkup: How much television do your kids watch? The Canadian Pediatric Society wants doctors to monitor how much time children are sitting in front of electronic screens. That's because excessive and inappropriate exposure can harm a child's physical, mental and social skills. The society wants parents to limit preschoolers to one hour of TV a day, while school children should watch no more than two hours daily. At current Canadian rates, the average high school graduate will have spent more time watching TV than they did learning in a classroom. Pediatricians say that not all television is bad. But there is a relationship between watching television and an increase in violent behaviour. The pediatricians believe television viewing frequently limits children's time to develop vital activities such as playing, reading, learning to talk, spending time with friends and family, storytelling, getting regular exercise, and developing other physical, mental and social skills. They also believe that too much time in front of the TV may contribute to childhood obesity. The pediatricians have come up with a list of ways of promoting good television viewing habits. Among the suggested habits are recommendations for parents to watch television with their children and discuss the programs. The pediatricians also believe televisions should be turned off during meal times."}]}, {"title": "French President Visits Nunavut", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What does Nunavut mean in the Inuktitut language of Canada's Inuit?", "id": "1999-W37-2-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When did Nunavut became Canada's newest territory?", "id": "1999-W37-2-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where did President Chirac arrive in the Nunavut territory?", "id": "1999-W37-2-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What are the Inuit in Nunavuk perfecting, according to French President Chirac?", "id": "1999-W37-2-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How much of the income in the Nunavut Territory comes from the art industry, according to Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien?", "id": "1999-W37-2-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What site in Nunavut did President Chirat visit?", "id": "1999-W37-2-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What did President Chirac open while he was in Nunavuk?", "id": "1999-W37-2-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "French President Jacques Chirac was full of praise yesterday for the people and the art of Nunavut.

Meanwhile, the search for more victims resumed at dawn today. Rescue workers picked through the wreckage, trying to account for missing passengers. Of the 150 people taken to area hospitals, reports say at least 14 are seriously injured. Many passengers cried as they described how they frantically crawled out broken windows in the aftermath. Others said they were haunted by the cries of those trapped in the wreckage. Authorities could not determine the total number of passengers aboard the trains. Great Western and Thames Trains are the companies that operate the two trains involved in the crash. Great Western said as many as 500 people might have been on board its train, which originated in Cheltenham, northwest of London, and was minutes away from its destination of Paddington Station. The Thames train, which may have been carrying up to 150 passengers, had just pulled out of the London station. Reports said both trains were traveling about 100 km/h when the Thames train tried to cross in front of the Great Western train.

The Canadian singing star made a special appearance at the high school to present officials with a $10,000 cheque for the purchase of music instruments. The cheque, and an accompanying pizza party, are courtesy of the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Inuksuk has been without a music program for about 10 years. This fall a music teacher was hired and the program was revived with money from the Baffin Divisional Education Council. Inuksuk's new music teacher, Ryan MacLeod, is now building a program from scratch with the help of the new instruments. The money went towards the purchase of 10-15 instruments. In total Inuksuk spent $40,000 on instruments this year, says Inuksuk co-principal Ken Sykes. The instruments arrived at the beginning of the school year. Students can rent instruments from the South, but MacLeod says running a successful music program in the North often requires providing instruments for students. \"We have a wider variety of economic backgrounds here. For some students where food and shelter is a more pressing concern, it is the responsibility of the music society and of the school to provide an instrument,\" MacLeod says. About 90 students, or a quarter of the school's population, are enrolled in music classes at Inuksuk. A single instrument is often shared between two or three students. MacLeod says that, ideally, each student should have his or her own instrument. MacLeod says it is common for northern communities to rally behind music programs. Music is often considered to be as important as subjects such as math or English, but it is a program that can give back to the community, he says. For example, the music society will be able to use the school's instruments and students may perform at community events, MacLeod said. \"Musicians can go out and perform and allow people to experience different emotions,\" MacLeod said."}]}, {"title": "A Refugee's Story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where in China did the woman come from?", "id": "1999-W47-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why can't the woman be identified by name?", "id": "1999-W47-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How many other people arrived in Canada with the woman?", "id": "1999-W47-5-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What will happen to the Chinese people whose requests for refugee status fail?", "id": "1999-W47-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "When did the woman get pregnant for the second time?", "id": "1999-W47-5-6", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How many children are Chinese couples allowed to have?", "id": "1999-W47-5-7", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What will happen to the woman if she returns to China?", "id": "1999-W47-5-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who is Larry Smeets?", "id": "1999-W47-5-11", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "One of the women from China's Fujian province told a compelling story to the Immigration and Refugee Board yesterday. She is applying to be accepted as a refugee to Canada. She was on one of the boats from China that was intercepted by the Coast Guard off the coast of British Columbia earlier this year. According to international law, a refugee is a person who has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to be protected by his own country. The Chinese woman can't be identified because of a legal order, but it seems her claim to be accepted as a refugee to Canada may succeed where the claims of 32 people who arrived with her have failed. They will be sent back to China. The woman says that seven years ago she got pregnant for the second time. That violates a Chinese law. Couples in China are only allowed to have one child. She tried to hide from the authorities, but they found her when she was eight months pregnant and took her to hospital. She said through an interpreter, \"The baby was born alive. They put the baby in a bucket. I heard the baby crying for a short time and I wanted to hold the baby but I couldn't. Later, the doctor told me the baby was no longer living.\" When she heard a ship was going to Canada, she decided to get on board. She planned to seek refugee status and bring her husband and child. So far, every refugee claim from the Chinese migrants has been rejected, usually because the board has found no evidence of persecution. This case may be different. The woman also says her family received a notice that she'll be sterilized so she can't have any more babies if she returns to China. Larry Smeets, her lawyer, says the Federal Court of Appeal has concluded in the past that forced sterilization was a form of persecution, so this reason could be recognized as a reason for refugees to be allowed to remain in Canada.

Is there any possibility that there is life there now? Early this afternoon, NASA's Mars Polar Lander touches down on the surface of the red planet. Scientists will get a chance to get the answers to many questions. The Polar Lander has been hurtling through hundreds of millions of kilometres of space for the past 11 months. It's hoped that the $200 million Polar Lander will help solve an old mystery -- whether there's ever been life-sustaining water on Earth's nearest planetary neighbour. The American space ship is being navigated by radio signals from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"It's a very complex process,\" says Sam Thurman, flight operations manager. \"There are literally years of effort by hundreds of different people behind making those five minutes of events happen.\" Once on the surface, the craft's instruments will be deployed -- some to test the atmosphere, others to claw out samples of dust and, possibly, ice. For the first time ever, NASA has included a microphone on a spacecraft sent to Mars, an idea originally proposed by astronomer Carl Sagan. There are fears that the costly mission could hit a rock or lose contact with NASA scientists back home. \"The biggest risk ... is Mars itself,\" says Sarah Gavit, NASA project manager. \"We have never been to the south pole of Mars before and we're not exactly sure what we are going into.\" Frozen water exists on Mars in its northern ice cap. But scientists believe there may be more underground. The Polar Lander will try to find evidence that the atmosphere was once warmer and thicker. Its landing site is believed to be an area where climate changes caused layering of dust and ice that can be read like the rings of a tree trunk.

The Grammy and Juno-award winning singer is very relieved, says her lawyer. British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Bruce Cohen dismissed the lawsuit by Darryl Neudorf. Neudorf wanted money and credit for four songs he says he helped write for McLachlan's 1988 debut album, \"Touch\". Neudorf, a former drummer with the band 54-40, was recruited to help the then-promising 19-year-old McLachlan, who had just recently moved to Vancouver from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to pursue a career as a recording artist. The producer testified he was hired - without a written contract - to help McLachlan develop songs for her first contract because she had never written songs before. He said he did not receive proper royalties for producing \"Touch,\" which sold more than 625,000 copies. McLachlan and the other defendants rejected Neudorf's claims, suggesting he was not hired to write songs, but rather to do pre-production work. They said Neudorf was properly compensated, receiving about $4,000 in wages and royalties worth 16 cents on each \"Touch\" album sold. McLachlan's lawyer Jennifer Conkie said the performer - the mastermind of the popular Lilith Fair concert series that toured North America - is \"very, very pleased and relieved.\" \"I think she shrieked with delight,\" Conkie said. During the trial, McLachlan occasionally sang and played a keyboard before court staff, reporters and teenaged fans to illustrate how songs are put together."}]}, {"title": "Newfoundland's Contaminated Tap Water", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where has the Newfoundland government found tap water contaminated?", "id": "2000-W02-3-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "How are trihalomethanes formed?", "id": "2000-W02-3-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Which towns face the danger of THMs in drinking water?", "id": "2000-W02-3-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Why do microbiological organisms have to be removed from water?", "id": "2000-W02-3-4", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "According to Fogo town manager Bruce Pomeroy, when should the government have made everyone aware if there were risks from THMs?", "id": "2000-W02-3-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "If water is left in an opened container for 24 hours, what happens to many of the chemicals?", "id": "2000-W02-3-9", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What does charcoal do to chemicals in water?", "id": "2000-W02-3-10", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "The Newfoundland government has found that the tap water in 63 communities is contaminated. The water contains higher than acceptable levels of chemicals known as trihalomethanes or THMs. These potentially dangerous chemicals have been linked to cancer and miscarriages (failed pregnancies). They are formed when tiny amounts of chlorine are added to drinking water. Chlorine - also known as \"bleach\" - is also added to the water in many swimming pools. You've no doubt noticed the smell. The danger of trihalomethanes in drinking water is faced mainly by small towns that can't afford expensive water filtration systems. Chlorination is necessary for two reasons. First, almost all sources of water contain microbiological organisms which have to be removed to prevent the outbreak of diseases such as typhoid fever and cholera. Second, once the treated water leaves the treatment plant, it travels through water pipes. During this trip, from the plant to your tap, it is necessary to have a disinfectant in the water to guard against the regrowth of microorganisms. Nova Scotia also recently identified 18 communities with unacceptably high levels of trihalomethanes. Newfoundland's environment minister says he plans to hire an expert who will look into reducing the amount of THMs in the water supply. In the meantime, Oliver Langdon says people shouldn't panic. \"People should not be alarmed about this matter. The benefits of disinfecting our water far outweigh the health effects of THMs.\" Many Newfoundland residents are upset with the government. They say the government has known there were problems but hid the facts from the public. Fogo town manager Bruce Pomeroy says that the government \"should have made everyone aware if there were risks -- like they are doing now -- two years ago.\" There are easy ways of getting rid of many of the THMs in drinking water. You can leave water in an open container for 24 hours, and many of the chemicals will evaporate. You can also pour the water through a charcoal-based water filter, like the popular ones many people keep in the fridge. The charcoal will absorb the chemicals."}]}, {"title": "Saving The Family Farm", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "When did reports of a crisis on Canadian farms first become national news?", "id": "2000-W02-5-1", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Where is the Family Farm Tribute concert being held?", "id": "2000-W02-5-2", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What is the Family Farm Tribute concert meant to do?", "id": "2000-W02-5-3", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "What two things will the Family Farm Tribute concert achieve, according to organizer Dennis Mills?", "id": "2000-W02-5-5", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}, {"question": "Who is meeting in Ottawa, Ontario, to work out a new aid package for cash-strapped farmers?", "id": "2000-W02-5-8", "is_impossible": false, "answers": []}], "context": "Amanda Scott is only seventeen years old, but she knows where her heart is: back on her family's farm near Brandon, Manitoba.

Government aid was promised to struggling farmers trying to keep their farms running. The crunch was particularly felt in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, among hog and grain farmers. But instead of complaining, Amanda is going on stage. This Sunday she's going to be singing in Toronto, Ontario, with some of the best-known names in Canadian music. It is called The Family Farm Tribute. The concert is meant to open people's eyes to the growing farm crisis in Canada. The lineup for the concert includes Gordon Lightfoot, Burton Cummings, Sylvia Tyson, Kevin Parent, Fred Penner and Sharon, Lois and Bram, as well as bands such as Wide Mouth Mason and Big Sugar. \"I know with my Dad the stress of not being able to get the crops in, it builds up, you know?\", says Amanda. \"And then also it's the pressure of continuing on with what your forefathers have started on the family farm.\" The concert is being organized by Liberal Member of Parliament Dennis Mills. He says the concert will achieve two things. It will bring rural problems to the attention of an urban audience, and it will show the country that Toronto cares. \"People beyond the 416 area code [the area code for Toronto], especially in the West, tend to think we are an evil, uncaring, don't-give-a-damn-kind of community. I know that's not the case and I think an event like this brings us together as a nation.\" The concert's not a sell-out yet. There were still 3,000 tickets available as of yesterday afternoon. Even if it's not packed to the rafters, Mills says the concert's message will still get out as people across the country can tune into the event live on CBC Newsworld. Federal Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief and his provincial counterparts are meeting today in Ottawa, Ontario, to work out a new aid package for cash-strapped farmers.

Morris Green of Nova Scotia Emergency Health Services said one of the teenagers was being treated for hypothermia -- when one's body temperature drops abnormally low -- and the other two appeared to be OK. John Morris Rankin played fiddle and piano with the popular musical family from Cape Breton. The group broke up last summer so its members could pursue independent careers and interests. Over a decade-long, storybook career, the Mabou, Nova Scotia family band rose from playing at county fairs and church halls to become the most successful music acts on the East Coast through the 1990s. The five siblings sold more than two million records, won five Juno Awards, including group of the year in 1994, and took its Celtic music to the world. Family friend and musician Denis Ryan said news of the accident spread quickly through the Nova Scotia music community. \"It's awful, awful, awful,\" said Ryan, who played music with Rankin in the mid '80s. \"I've known him for 25 years.... Why is it always the good people that die?\" Ryan described Rankin as a dedicated family man and master carpenter who was like a younger brother to him. \"He was just a beautiful person to be around -- never offensive and could be awful funny at times.

He could laugh and smile and have fun with very simple things in life.\" Rankin's brother Jimmy Rankin left a Farm Aid concert in Toronto after being notified of the death.

Polar Lander was to have touched down December 3 for a 90-day mission. It was to land near Mars' south pole. The lander was last heard from minutes before beginning its descent. The last effort to communicate with the three-legged lander ended with frustration at 8 a.m Monday. \"We didn't see anything,\" said Richard Cook, the spacecraft's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The failed mission to the Red Planet cost the American government more than $200 million dollars. Now, space agency scientists and engineers will try to find out what could have gone wrong. They do not want to make the same mistakes in the next mission. Controllers have been testing dozens of different scenarios to try and explain what might have happened to the lander. Nobody knows exactly what happened to the lander, but there are several theories. The Mars Polar Lander could have touched down on the side of a canyon and toppled over. Some people think the lander could have exploded before entering the atmosphere. Others say its radio systems might have failed, or that the lander could have sunk into Martian dust. NASA sent a spacecraft called the Mars Global Surveyor to take high-resolution images of the landing site to search for signs of the lander. NASA hoped the orbiter would spot the lander's parachute or shadow. But so far attempts to capture a picture of the lander's parachute have been unsuccessful. Another lander and orbiter are scheduled to launch next year, but at least part of the mission is now in doubt. \"The orbiter for sure will happen. There's no issue there,\" Mr. Cook says. \"The lander they're still talking about.\" The Polar Lander Spacecraft was 1.06 metres tall by 3.6 metres wide.

They have threatened to move to the United States - where they say business is better - unless the government helps them out. Yesterday Industry Minister John Manley finally agreed. He has given the go-ahead to negotiate subsidies (money given to help out) on a team-by-team basis. Some teams will get more. Others will get less. The subsidies could add up to millions of dollars. The reaction to the program has been very mixed. In the Montreal Canadiens dressing room, winger Turner Stevenson of Prince George, British Columbia, is very happy. \"People see it as the government giving us free money, but look how much tax we pay,\" he says. \"Guys make a million, but they pay half of that in taxes.\" The average NHL player makes 1.3 million dollars a season. But Olympic 100 metre sprinter Glenroy Gilbert is disgusted. He says that it is not fair that millionaire hockey players like Turner Stevenson and Pavel Bure are getting help while hundreds of Olympic athletes have to scramble every month just to pay their bills. \"I've been doing this for 13 or 14 years, running on the national team and we've been forced to live on from $450 a month to $810 a month,\" Gilbert said from Austin, Texas, where he is training for the Sydney Olympics. \"That barely pays your rent.\" Other groups are equally upset.

Mehta had obtained permission to shoot the film from the Indian federal Information and Broadcasting Ministry, as well as the government of the state where the film is being shot.

Varanasi is considered one of India's oldest and most religious cities. Now, after a meeting with the federal Information and Broadcasting minister, Mehta has been given permission to resume shooting. Mehta says the attack has cost the production about a million dollars in damage and delays in the shooting schedule.

Haider has made remarks, for which he has since apologized, that downplay Nazi crimes in Germany in the 1930's and during the Second World War. He has not publicly made anti-Semitic (anti-Jewish) remarks and has said that his party has Jewish members. Haider arrived in Montreal for a visit shrouded in secrecy. Jewish and human rights groups in Canada and the United States condemned his visit. Dozens of people made signs and set up protest marches in Ottawa and Montreal. Rabbi Marvin Hier said he understood Haider had flown to Montreal to try to attend the wedding of a well known Hasidic leader's relative on Wednesday evening. Hasidic Jews believe that religion governs every minute of their life. They are the most visible members of the Jewish community because even their clothes reflect their beliefs. Hundreds of thousands of Hasidic Jews were killed by Nazis. Heshy Weinberger, a spokesman for the Tash Hasidic community in a Montreal suburb, says it is not true that Heider was invited to attend the wedding. Weinberger says the community, which counts many Holocaust survivors among its 300 families, was overwhelmed by the controversy sparked by rumors that they had invited Haider. On Wednesday, Haider's associates requested a tour of Montreal's Holocaust Memorial Center, but were told they could not visit. Haider was also photographed playfully juggling a snowball at the city's memorial to Raoul Wallenberg, a European hero who saved many Jews during the holocaust. This seems to prove accusations that the two-day trip was a bid for publicity. In an interview published in Montreal's The Gazette, Haider said he and the Freedom Party he leads are being unfairly demonized as neo-fascists by his opponents. Haider's party won 27 percent of the vote in Austria's last election, and earlier this month they joined the conservative People's Party in a coalition government. Since then, many European nations have shunned Austria, and its relations with the United States and Canada have been strained."}]}]}
